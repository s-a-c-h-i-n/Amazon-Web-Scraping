1.0 out of 5 stars,"Brightness is very low. I was using OnePlus 5. 20% of brightness in OnePlus 5 is equal to 65% brightness in 6T which may cause  in draining the battery. Not happy with it. Also unlocking with fingerprint is not up to the mark. Totally not so happy with it. Thinking to return it and use OnePlus 5 only

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First and foremost...I really dont miss those 3.5 mm jack. Using bluetooth earpiece and the sound quality is top notch.Picture quality - initial shots taken are impressive.Battery life is best among all one plus phones.Build quality is superb. No issues with call clarity and now the best part...Oxygen OS. Its buttery smooth, fluidic and unputdownable. You will ne addicted to it.Only con is the weight of the device.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Phone is getting hanged and face unlock is not working. I received a phone on 8th November and logged a call with amazon on 9th november that my phone is getting hanged frequently and face unlock is not working properly. They have scheduled the technician visit on 11th November, however, technician not visited. I called amazon related technician, executive told me that technician not visited due to some personal reasons. They don't bother to inform customer if technician are not going to visit.Worst experience faced ever.Don't buy anything from Amazon.I have requested for replacement,but they're denying for replacement.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Impressive at this price point. Only disappointment is  absence 3.5 mm headphone jack. Had Oneplus supplied bullets headphone as default accessory, it would have been a complete package. Apple, learn from it, else your days are numbered.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I pre-ordered the phone on 9th Oct and literally waited for more than a month for this phone. It was worth waiting.Phone looks similar to one plus 6 however the technology you get in this phone is updated and is latest. The notch looks beautiful compared to other waterdrop notch phones. I'm not an audiphile so can't complain much about the removal of headphone jack. I'm pretty comfortable with wireless earphones. The OS is something which needs to be considered the most on a phone, which most of the people ignore. I migrated from a Sony phone and see a huge difference in the usage, the OS is smooth as butter and is calibrated for daily driver. You can perform many tasks at a snap of your fingers and never experience a lag on the phone. Camera is good, clicks are clear. Portrait and night mode are very useful and handy. Slow motion works well. Battery life is comparably good, you get around 6 hrs of SOT from a full charge. I feel that's more than enough for a daily driver and works well for gamers. Charging is pretty fast you can charge the phone from 0 to 100 in 1 hr 20min.I feel it's worth paying 40k for a premium phone like this, which offers good support for your OS and provides Android updates for 2 yrs. Rather than spending 25k+ for plastic and non premium phones. BTW this comes with no bloatware and is completely based on stock OS which contains a lot of tweaks and customizatios. That's the best part of the phone.Go for it if you don't want to compromise !!

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: Hardware supports good speed and camera.Cons: Screen unlock doesn't work most of the time. Fingerprint is not upto mark and takes a few tries. Also Google smart Lock is not working. There was a defect on the screen protector applied and Amazon says that they product will not be replaced and they cannot do anything about it. Oneplus says buy a new tempered glass and put it!! Fingerprint sensor is hardly able to cope with the normal plastic protector. I don't know how will it work with a thick one. This was the first time I had problem with a product from Amazon and they showed their true colors. Sameer goes for OnePlus.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Picture quality is good. Battery life is decent. Sound quality is okay. It's not a beast in any regards considering it's price and the flagship killer tag. You may miss the notification led and the 3.5 mm audio jack. The in screen fingerprint reader is a cool feature but surely feels that first gen not so smooth feature. It just gives you the feeling of not buying a finished product but a work in progress kind of a thing. Not many things to complaint about since it does give you good specifications for a decent price but.. it's no longer a flagship killer to stay. One plus may very well be the new apple. I'd hate to see that happen, but they're in the business for profit afterall. It can't always all be about the community. But I see them get run over by budget phones if their competition could maintain quality

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Coming from OnePlus 2, this is a huge upgrade. So I liked many things about this phone. Amazing display. I'm not a notch fan but this is the cutest notch I've seen. Absence of 3.5mm jack might be a let down for many fans including me and I still don't agree with their decision. There is no LED notifications also.Performance wise there's no need of even comparing because this is the best (SD845+OxygenOS+8GB RAM = TRUE WONDER).Didn't get a chance to test the camera much, so no comments on the camera.Some might face problems with fingerprint scanner but register them properly and you would not get any problems. I had none till now.I didn't think that the case in the box would be so good. It's very nice and I've seen phone dropping from 10ft not breaking with this case.Many intrusive ads are comparing this with Pocophone F1. I just laugh at them. OnePlus has a way more premium feel than Pocophone.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"There are two speakers in One Plus 6T, One speaker is not working
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"DESIGN:If you thinking that OnePlus 6 and 6T has no major difference than you are absolutely wrong and highly mistaken if you thing 6 is better than 6T. Price hike is completely justified.Visible differences between 6 & 6T:Higher screen to body ratio, Gorilla Glass 6, in-display fingerprint scanner, taller, water-drop notch. 3700mAh battery.Technical advancement:Advance AI which smartly uses your RAM and ROM which actually boosts the performance, Better heat-sink than 6.CAMERA:I took my canon 1300D with two lens; portrait and 18-55 and OnePlus6T for comparison test. OnePlus 6T provided better results when both on Auto-mode. It has amazing contrast, perfect saturation; but the thing where it stood-out from others its it night picture quality. It does wonders even if there is almost no light and that is some magic over there. Front camera absolutely stunning and comes with screen flash for low light selfies.BATTERY:Battery charging- 0 to 65% in 30 mins and at 45 min it reaches 86%. Full charge by 1hr8 mins when internet, Bluetooth and wifi off. On heavy use it survives 8 hrs (I watched 2 movies in HD with 50% screen brightness and 1 hour PubG gaming on HD, 1 hour YouTubing). On average usage, 17 hours very smoothly(casual social media surfing, browsing, camera usage about 5 to 6 pictures using flash). Without internet usage at all and battery saver on, it can go whooping 3 DAYS !SPEAKERS:External speakers are loud, I mean really very loud. Hearing speaker is very cool by its looks and loud too. Volume rockers and power switch is perfectly hard.SECURITY:Though I feel face detection is worst type of security because it has many drawbacks, its quick. And finger print scanner is also faster than its competitors. The part which irritates is that while using at night in dark, for face and fingerprint detection, the display gets 100% to scan which is very annoying and very uneasy for eyes.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a big fan of Apple. Have been using Iphone from last 5 years. Wanted to change the phone to the new one. But not much of Innovation from Apple. So, I switched to Oneplus and Oneplus 6T was a best replacement.The OnePlus 6T brings new technology and worthwhile improvements to the table making this the best phone from OnePlus yet.Design: Just gorgeous - the curve of the camera bump is more of a design accent than a notch. The phone has a huge 6.41 in screen, but is still easily managed with one hand. The color is amazing - Mirror Black. The 6T feels like it was meant to fit in my hand. The first party OnePlus cases accent the amazing design and make it even more comfortable. When you hold the phone, you will know exactly what I mean!Battery: Lasts more than a day with heavy use. I can get almost 6 hrs of screen on time even after watching YouTube, gaming, and general usage. Even better, the included dash charger fills the battery extremely quickly. No wireless charging, but I don't even miss it.Camera: Solid - 4K 60FPS video looks great. Other phones in this price range can't even touch the quality of the camera for pictures. Night shot is solid, looking forward to Future tweeks to prevent the blown out appearance when some light is present.Sound: Probably the only change I would make. The since downward firing speaker is easy to block. The quality is great - would love to see the dual speaker in the next OnePlus phone.While you could say that OnePlus has made some sacrifices in developing the OnePlus 6T, they all seem rather subjective. Sure it’s a slightly bigger, thicker, heavier phone than the 6 but if that means a bigger battery with better longevity is it really a loss?The headphone jack’s absence is annoying for some but the phone comes with an adapter and the in-display fingerprint sensor might not have fit in the same footprint otherwise.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has by far been the best phone I have ever used hands-on. Flagship Specs, Classy look, Premium Packaging and the Speed you Need!Appearance - The device looks very much similar to the OnePlus 6T upfront but it has got the speed orange highlights at the back, carbon finish and McLaren Branding at the bottom.Camera - The night mode really captures amazing pictures and the portrait mode is just amazing. The low light photography could still be improved.Battery - With average usage with full day data on, it easily lasts upto 2 days. The Warp charging is just amazing, it takes around 40-45 mins to charge from 0-100%. But you could easily get a day's charge within 20 mins.Speed - With 10 Gigs of RAM, speed should not be a question. You could open up 5 high specs games and it still wouldn't lag. And its bragging rights for sure!Overall, I am really satisfied with this device and feels great to be a part of OnePlus Community! Go, get it! Its for those, who are in continuous pursuit for speed!

1.0 out of 5 stars,"The in-display fingerprint sensor is very bad. It is slow and many times it takes multiple attempts to scan the finger. This phone is big disappointment. I would not recommend this phone at all.They didn't give headphone jack which is okay as they were giving free bullets V2 for those who pre-booked the phone. But they should atleast have given IP rating as IP gives peace of mind and stereo speaker should have been there instead of dummy holes at bottom. Needless to say that Oneplus phones have good software and this one is no exception. This has good software which is fast and fluid. My point is that don't buy this phone for fingerprint sensor. If you are having other OnePlus phone then you should hold for next OnePlus phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The most COMPLETE and HONEST review :-This phone is OUTSTANDING! Mostly in a really good sense, ALTHOUGH somewhere we HAVE TO SETTLE.CONS (Ranked) -1. NO STEREO SPEAKERS , although single mono speaker is good.2. HEADPHONE AUDIO OUTPUT (c type / 3.5 mm / whatever) is ABOVE AVERAGE, but should have been better with greater bass and more fuller ambient sound like LG G7 ThinQ etc. I'll update my review about the Cirrus Logic DAC and Oneplus C type Bullets later.3. Camera depends upon good lighting conditions. TOO MUCH CROP IN FRONT CAMERA VIDEO DUE TO EIS. BLUR IN NIGHTSCAPE, ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S MOVEMENT IN FRAME. Wide angle camera should have been a must.4. Fingerprint scanner is like 90% hit and 10% miss. For 97% hit and 3% miss, INPUT SAME FINGER TWICE OR THRICE. PROPER PLACEMENT OF FINGER ON SCANNER is IMPORTANT. However it's SUFFICIENTLY FAST. Placement should have been upper on the screen.5. NO NOTIFICATION LED. SCREEN OFF GESTURES (like O for camera) are HITS AND MISSES OCCASIONALLY.P. S. NO HEADPHONE JACK, NO QHD RESOLUTION and NO WIRELESS CHARGING are NOT CONS, atleast for me.PROS (Ranked) -1. The very BEST SOFTWARE, UI, PERFORMANCE. (CLEAN, FAST AND SMOOTH). MANY CUSTOMISATIONS. BETTER THAN STOCK ANDROID.2. INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY and DESIGN like in display fingerprint scanner, cute waterdrop notch etc.3. PREMIUM AND DURABLE BUILD QUALITY. UNOFFICIALLY WATERPROOF.4. GREAT BATTERY life AND DASH CHARGING.5. Great screen.6. Camera can compete with PIXEL 3.7. GREAT VALUE for the price. However, COULD BE of GREATER VALUE. COMPETITION - LG G7 ThinQ, Asus Zenfone 5Z, iPhone 6S plus, etc.P. S. You'll read many PROS in official reviews in the internet, YouTube etc..All in all, the phone and the brand DESERVES YOUR ATTENTION.4.5 OUT OF 5 - ABHISHEK CHAKRAVORTY

Since Asus Zenfone 5Z also gives similar performance at almost less than 10K. Camera in night mode needs more improvement and does not capture the picture properly .. may be i need to do some tweeks in settings i am not sure. Please see the image i uploaded the fire is tarnished with grey .. same picture without night mode is much better. This is my first 1+ phone .. satisfied but because of camera giving 4 stars.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"OnePlus 6T ProsBigger display with water drop notch design look beautiful and AMOLED panel also very good.OnePlus 6T has upgraded 370mAh battery which is 400mAh bigger then OnePlus 6. It also comes with Dash charger one of the fastest smartphone chargers.The base variant comes with 6GB RAM 128GB of storage and price are same as OnePlus 6 6GB RAM 128GB storage variant.The main highlight it has the in-display fingerprint sensor and this is one of the fastest in-display fingerprint sensors.OnePlus known for their stock like Oxygen OS and this time the OnePlus 6T comes with Android 9 pie.New Camera mode like Nightscape and some other photography features are really good.OnePlus 6T ConsThe Oneplus company known to listen to their consumer’s voice, but this time There is no 3.5mm audio jack.The main cons of all OnePlus devices are lacs on microSD card support, yes it does not have any microSD card slot.There is no IP rating for waterproof and dustproof.OnePlus 6T does not have dual speakers like it should because other brands are now offering dual speaker setup.This time OnePlus also use glass at the back but it does not support wireless charging. Now, these days every flagship smartphone has wireless charging support.Frankly speaking the OnePlus 6 still a good device there is no major improvement on OnePlus 6T. If you are a OnePlus fan and wants to buy a new smartphone then you can buy this. But if you already have the OnePlus 6 then don’t waste your money because OnePlus 6 will get all the software feature via OTA updates...

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall: 8/10:A fantastic package at good value. 6T McLaren is'nt much different from the standard 6T except for the RAM and some minor cosmetic changes. But for a long time fan of the Silver Arrows from Mika Hakkinen's time, a small increase in price was worth it. Call me sentimental! :)Unboxing & contents: 8/10One of the coolest unboxing experiences. The McLaren box is very premium and the booklet starts with giving you a brief glimpse into the history of the brand and some cool pictures from the archives. It is an homage to Bruce McLaren to be honest. The Speed Mark (real Carbon Fire cutout of the McLaren logo) encased in acrylic is pretty good and can serve as a cool table top accessory or paper weight. If not for much it can be a good ice breaker for visitors to your home / office. The Charger and Cable are also customized for the McLaren edition. The Soft PU case is simple black and fits snugly. There was a missed opportunity to throw in some colour for the McLaren edition. All else is pretty much standard. Providing only a USB-C to 3.5 converter is a bummer. For the flagship offering at over 50K, throwing in a Bullet Earphone should have been standard.First Impressions: 9/10The device is actually pretty impressive looking. Especially the orange accents at the Bezel on the back. When you change the angle under light, it almost looks like there are LEDs inside. It looks premium for sure though an actual Carbon Fibre body would have been awesome! Be warned though that the surface is a fingerprint magnet and not easy to wipe off unless you use a good cleaning spray. The Waterdrop notch is barely noticeable and is not much of an issue. The colours are vibrant and while setting up you can choose a profile that suits your taste.Setup: 8/10The SIM Card tray is a standard two Nano-SIM one. No SD Card support still! But with 240 GB usable memory, not much of an issue to be honest. I used the OnePlus switch app to transfer my apps, data and settings. The transition was hassle free and took all of 15 minutes. Most apps worked immediately but a few needed to be uninstalled and reinstalled as they were acting up. I gave it a point less as I think the OnePlus Switch app should be integrated at the setup stage instead of making a new user download it. The phone heats up considerably but it was fine after the initial 30 minutes.Battery: 7/10The unit came with 50% power out of the box and it took me a good 30 minutes to get it to 75% despite using the Warp Charge @ 30W. Probably it was due to the fact that close to 100 apps were being downloaded while it was charging. I will check the charging performance over the next few weeks and update review if required.Performance: 9/10Gaming: Initial performance on gaming is very very good (Asphalt 9 Legends and Real Racing 3). Zero lag and super smooth rendering.  Bloons TD6 is a very resource hungry at lategame levels and the 6T McLaren  made short work of it.Display: The display is really mind-blowing. Video on Youtube and other streaming apps was super smooth and brilliant to look at. One cool feature is that you can pinch zoom the content to include / exclude the waterdrop notch for front camera.  Adaptive brightness is annoying at times and I had to turn it off while playing the racing games.Camera: Have not tested the Camera performance yet. Especially the 4K 60 FPS option. Will do it soon and update the review.Hope this helps!

It's been 4 days since I got OnePlus 6T and I have charged only a couple of times for an hour or so each time; the battery is just brilliant. If you are someone who loves to click pictures and take selfies, you won't be disappointed with the various features of the camera in this phone.  I got 6 gigs of ram and 128 storage space in this phone, and it's damn quick and no lags or hangs so far! If you don't like the notch, not to worry, you will be able to disable it.One major disappointment was the 3.5mm jack's death. However, with their Type-C headphone adapter, you can manage to plug in your 3.5mm headphones.Lastly, if you are someone who's upgrading from OnePlus 3rd Gen., 5th Gen., or 6, consider waiting for the next phone from OnePlus.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"My earlier OP phone gave up on my a little while ago and I wasn't sure if I should wait for the 6T to launch or just go for another phone. I'm glad I waited. The OP 6T is a beast of a device. The screen is just beautiful and the gestures so smooth. Using the device is just a satisfying experience. The battery life is also incredible. Easily gets me through two days of average usage. The finger print reader is slightly slower compared to other devices with regular scanners, but its not something to be put off by. The only con I have about the device is the single downward facing speaker. It can easily be covered depending on how you hold the phone so not really a great experience while watching something especially in landscape mode. Otherwise, don't think twice about getting this phone. Just go for it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using this device for over a week now and so far it has turned out to be a beast of a device. Here are my observations:1. The in-display screen unlocker: It is flawed. Takes a bit of a time to unlock and you have to place the finger properly. But this was not that big of a deal, since the face unlocking is supremely fast. Its a novelty kind of thing. looks nice when it works. 4/5 for this2. Camera: my previous device was OP 5t. The picture quality has increased manifold. Nightscape, studio lighting and ultra slo-mo video works like a charm. 5/5 for this3. Battery life: the first day, the device got slightly heated when i used oneplus switch so the battery drained quickly. But over the week, it has given me wonderful battery backup. No heating issue. With average to heavier usage, it still gave me 1.5 days backup. The charging is very fast. 40 minutes to charge from 10 to 95%. More than sufficient. 4.75/5 for this4. Speaker: Only one speaker is present, but it gives out very loud output. Gives very good clarity and loud ringing. No complaints or issues regarding this. 5/55. OS: It is the cleanest and simplest OS yet. Lots and lots of customization, minimum bloatware. clean interface. in OP5T, the messaging app did not differentiate between marketing related messages and actual messages. fortunately, this phone has that capability. Loved the gestures as well. Optimizations are also great new feature. 5/56. Build: All one plus devices are wonderfully built and 6T is no exception. Even though the glass back is there, I didnt find any slippage. Of course I am using the back cover which is already provided with the phone now. But I think it has much better grip than the other phones. 5/5Bottom line is that this is a device which you would want to own for a long time. Most of the budget phones start developing problems within 1 year of manufacturing, but that has not been my experience with One plus devices.  Even after more than 1 year of using OP 5T, I still got the same performance I was getting during my first month with it. 6T is slightly costly but completely worth it in my opinion.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for a long time for the Oneplus 6T model launch. I purchased it with lots of expectations and I am happy that it met my most of the expectations. I purchased Oneplus 6T 128gb and 6gb RAM version mirror black phone.Pros :-1) Super fast processor- can play large games without any glitch.2) Camera is super amazing. However in the night mode, the pictures are sometimes hazy. Overall it is good.3) The phone is damn beautiful. The back of the phone is simply outstanding. Notch also looks cute.4) Fingerprint sensor is working fine.5) Sound quality is good. The speakers are loud and  bass is also good. However, the company should have launched it with dual speakers. It would have been phenomenal.6) The company has increased the battery size. It gives a backup of atleast 1.5 days with normal usage.Cons:-1) NO HEADPHONE JACK. The company was making fun of Apple for removing the headphone jack, but they did the same. I just have a doubt that how will I charge my phone and watch a movie via earphones at the same time. I have to buy an external adapter which will put a dent on my pocket again.2) If I am holding my phone and have put my thumb impression as my Fingerprint phone unlock option. Then sometimes it is difficult to unlock the phone. Coz while holding the phone I have to put my thumb straight which is quite difficult.3) The night mode of the camera needs improvement.4) No dual speaker.Conclusion:It is a nice phone with brilliant specifications. It easily beats some of the high end phones of Apple , Samsung and LG and others. So you may go for it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Here is my review of op6 McLaren Edn after 4 days of uses.Camera is excellent, takes outstanding pictures. Sound quality is ok but not at par. Oneplus could have done better.Battery life is phenomenal. Lasts for almost 30 hours with 10 hours of screen on time. Running 4g all the time.The one and only con that I observed is internet speed is very slow . I saw someone's review before buying this phone that network strength is very good compared to other phones and indeed it is. But inspite of having good signals, the 4g internet speed is very slow. And I mean very slow like 2g. McLaren doesn't stand up to its name. Did all the tricks, read all the forums about the solution but nothing worked. Same sim is giving excellent speed in another phone.I feel like cheated. Whats the point keeping superfast phone if you cannot have a fast internet.Won't recommend anyone to buy this phone.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall amazing product for the price point .. but now its on the edge. One plus has been slowly increasing prices year on year and now they are in INR40K range. Further one or more price hikes and people will start going back to Flagship companies. Lets hope they keep it as Value for money.Regarding phone:Superb edge to edge display & battery life  - No complaints here. 1080P screen is crisp enough and gives good battery life. Notch is actually just tiny camera and bottom chin has become further thinner.Software: Oxygen OS -  as usual its clean and gives stock experience with few customizations. Since phone has been just launched have experienced few bugs, but lets hope one plus gives quick updates to solve these.Build Quality/looks: Thumbs Up! to OnePlus. Glass black and body design does give premium feel. But somehow felt phone is on heavier side (I have switched from OnePlus5 to OnePlus6T and definitely there's noticeable difference in weight).Fingerprint scanner: Works well most of the times but not as fast as physical fingerprint scanners we have been used to of earlier phones. If screen gets smudgy you will have problem of unlocking device as it requires clean surface to work.Only cons, I have experienced in this phone are No headphone jack and LED notification light. Most useful part of LED light was of charging notification. Now you have to wake screen and check. For headphones you do get C-Type connector but as it sounds ""No 3.5mm headphone Jack"" -  nothing to describe here.But overall its a good package and still its a Value for money! You can go for it for sure.

She previously had iphone 8 and believe me she loved the oneplus.I am myself using a oneplus 6 and while comparing it with the T version.There are only slight differences apartment from the notch size battery capacity and  on screen fingerprint reader.I particularly doesn't feel for the need for a quad HD screen since the screen quality is amazing.They could have added bwtter camera modules and instead of the depth sensor , they could have put a telescopic lensSpeaker quality has improved from the 6 but they should have added stereo speakers.I know some are xomolaing about the jack but sooner or later everyone will start using Bluetooth headphones, just like touch screen phone made a revolution.The biggest upgrade that i personally feel is the 400mah increase in battery capacity.I never had any issues with the 6 but the 6t wouod easily last 2 days for a moderate user

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Firstly i would like to thank oneplus for making a device like that. The best part of the phone is the performance which you expect from a snapdragon 845 chip  ..  obviously you are paying for that.(Or han"" don't do the math"" i have poco f1 too,, 6t is better in everything. worth paying more.. )*Now the Issues are..1.  Lack of 3.5mm jack  which can be a deal breaker for many people.  But honestly not for me.  Because i don't have a wired earphone or headphone. It's 2k18 even my car doesn't have an aux port.  (Android auto).  If still u want to use then there is a connector comes with the box.2 .  Notification led.If they provided a led on the top of display then you have to compromise with that beautiful notch.  Again not a deal breaker.*Important*I have seen many people are saying in reviews. That they have not received cash back  or type c bullet earphones with box.  Not sure about. The cash back. But. If you pre book this device. It is mentioned that u will receive a code to purchase those earphones by 15 nov.  U will not get those with the box..And about the cash back i had purchased it at rs 46k(8ram 256rom) nd  i received that 1000 instantly nd 500 on 5th  nov.Chaliye ab kuch buraiya bhi karde*Sound quality can be better..*Not ip certified. It is just splash proof (but i don't know how to swim so I'm not taking my phone in pool... again not a deal breaker)Buss ab kharid lia or burai nhi hoti.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone overall is supposed to be flagship killer. But the truth is that despite killing flagship it can’t kill the performance and stability of the previous model one plus 6. As someone who has both the phones in the family my observation is in comparison with one plus 6 and I feel one plus has gone down on the standards with the new phone.ProsBetter sound than 6Photos have better depth and clarityBattery back up is goodConsFingerprint unlock is absolutely lacking performance and does not work at timesPhone hangs at times and does not feel like it’s a one plus product or having 6 gb ramCamera freezes and sometime renders all buttons including power button action lessHope OnePlus comes with a sw update to handle all the issues, else this is gonna bring bad press for them.

5.0 out of 5 stars," Hello Guys, it’s been 1 week since I got (8GB/256GB) one of the best phone in market. As expected OnePlus deliver customs expectations.Regarding phone it’s of course best in the market, battery charging takes around 75 minutes from 5% to 100%. Discharging is pretty normal compared to its competitors. Photo clarity is good enough in normal/ portrait mode but night mode I don’t feel good enough, it takes longer time to stabilise and we need to hold and wait. Video and photo clarity is good but not the best in market or less comparatively than my Lumia 950XL. Fingerprint sensor is not much sensitive and takes .5 to 1 sec to open, had a angle problem which resolved in recent update but still lag remains same. Face recognition is perfect. I feel phone is in top 5 for gaming with separate gaming mode, don’t see any lag in WCC 2/ Asphalt/ PUBG. Screen size, display is pretty good and as expected. Sound quality is same as it’s lower end models no much difference. Overall I am happy with other specifics except night mode, fingerprint sensor.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am writing this review ,after usage of 15 days.Phone is fabulous, build quality is also excellent.Sound quality:If you often listen music loudly then you may not like it, as it does not have dual speaker, so either buy a good JBL or Bose speakers or look for another phone.Battery Life: Its Dash charge bro, my 6t got fully charged in 1:28 hours from 0to99.Typical usage, may lead one or one and half day battery.(Typical means listening song, often watching YouTube or online movie etc.)It gets slightly warm while charging , later I found that it's normal .Software :It has oxygen is , except pixel of Google . One plus is the only brand in android to provide updates time to time. Software is also very smooth to use.Hardware:Snapdragon 845 very fast,Con:no qhd display,no led notification light.Pros: On screen fingerprint ,very fast as compared to any other on screen fingerprint, but slightly slower than typical fingerprint.(Its 0.3sec., typical opens in0.15 to0.20sec)I also noticed that of you kept your phone inactive for half an hour and suddenly use fingerprint on display it takes slightly more time than usual (approx. 0.8secto 0.6sec.) Later it will work fast and fine.Service: Its a start up, so authorised one plus service centre are mostly in big cities like Bangalore,Pune , Mumbai, Delhi etc.Summary:GO FOR IT, I switched from iPhone 6s to one plus 6t , I don't regret it,and you will also.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best Android phone till date. I have been using it for 3 days now and OnePlus didn't let me down.* Great battery life. I use mobile for texting, taking pics and pubg usually. I charge it once a day which is pretty great.* Dash charging does help the phone to get charged to 90% in 50-60mins (3700mAh).* You all know about the specs abt camera. But one thing to note is unlike oneplus 6, 6t's pro mode has bigger capture size.* On screen finger print scanner amazes me each time I use it. Animation is so great. One thing i'd like to mention abt this animation is it is too bright even when brightness of the screen is minimum which is bad when you want to unlock ur phone at night time.This is the best phone you can buy in 2018 and early 2019 at around 35-40k. So go ahead and buy it, I'm sure you won't regret it!

3.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone is excellent software and internals wise. However the cons are as follows:- all glass. Serves no purpose and makes the phone fragile- no notification light- no headphone jack. Pointless omission simply to ape Apple- ambient display brightens up too much for sensing fingerprint and is very irritating at night- phone is a tad too big. They should ideally have kept the 5.5 screen size from the op5 days and removed the bezels instead of increasing the size of the phone- terrible vibration motor. My old nokias from the last decade had much better vibration. Not expected from such a premium phone

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first OnePlus Device and it feels amazing that how fast this phone is! I switched from Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and I'm glad I did....Battery life is just outstanding and I've never ever got such a powerful battery ever in my smartphone life. It actually lasts more than a day with lots of playing (I'm a Gamer) and general usage. Camera is also very good and certainly better than my previous phone. UI is clean and lightning fast. Build quality and finish is premium, sturdy and not at all fragile. The in-box Type-C to 3.5mm Adapter solves the absence of headphone jack problem. The supplied case is of premium quality and easily gives all-round protection to any angle falls. Dash charging is superb too. Android Pie out-of-the-box is cool but restricts call recording from third party apps (which is must for me), but OP did a fantastic job of putting in-built call recorder which works flawlessly in Pie as well. As of now, I don't see a single negative point for this phone. Its truly a remarkable one! Thank You OnePlus and Amazon!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been blown away by the performance of this phone.. Everything is smooth and easy. So lets talk about pros and cons:Pros:1. Screen quality is great and due to the rain drop notch the real estate has increased drastically.2. Battery life is the best. You charge it once and even after full day use, its around 30 percent. No need to carry a charger now.3. With Android pie the apps run smoothly without a hitch and after a month of purchase, its already been updated thrice.4. Wifi connectivity has increased as compared to earlier models.5. Due to its aspect ratio, the phone is easy to use by one hand.Cons:1. Camera is good but not too great as the features are basic. One plus needs to work on its camera app and give more features to use double lenses effectively. The video has stability issues.2. The sound quality is better than earleir models but still needs to be louder.3. The screen protector is a smudge magnet and i would suggest a better screen protector.4. The sunlight visibility is not too great.Still after considering all these factors the phone is great and people tend to notice it in your hand.My verdict:Worth buying. Go for it. You will surely be excited.

I have trusted on oneplus instead of Iphone , but the result is opposite. Finally, waste of money and time ,battery backup is also worst, launching the game app phone got hanged.

Some one told me that the indisplay finger print scanner is not a good idea and face unlock is not good in this phone but I feel indisplay finger print response is so quick(not fast as physical finger print) face unlock is a flaw because you can see there are separate hardware require for the face unlock so that your phone will be secure. Most of the phones come with face unlock using camera but that's not a good idea. You should have in built hardware to setup your phone in safe and secure like iPhone and recently Huawei mate 20 pro which has in built hardware like dot projection. Ram and memory management are good. Camera is not the best but I feel it's good and the night mode is also good. Gaming mode is ultimate. Battery is good as I turn my internet and stream YouTube and it last for more than a half day. If you are a heavy user you can use 8 hours max.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got 8GB * 128GB version. The review it in a word, it's a beast. CNET mentioned it as ""Hero phone without sky high Price"". It's true. At this price range it's a great value for money.  OnePlusen launching amazing phone's and this is the latest of the greats. No bloatware at all, nothing pre-installed except few handy OnePlus apps for file transfer and a forum, Definitely enhances the Pure Android OS.Games are running at ultra or high. Haven't hanged at all with lot of apps running, gaming is smooth and this one has a RAM optimiser for the purpose, its my 1st time with SD 845, best fit into this. Good picture clarity too, nearly 2k.Camera is great, especially the portrait mode. Selfies are neat. Though the 2nd lens purpose is limited, reading from most reviews.Amazing UI, appreciation is heartfelt.The build is brilliant and sleek. Comfortable to put it in pant pockets and can be handled with one hand though I won't necessarily do that 😄. Notch is unobtrusive and looks cool, and hiding option available. Night mode is a good thought. I don't have to download an extra app. (My 1st time with an OnePlus and I'm happy about the handy features it comes with, if some features I'm mentioning is already there leave it). In-display FP sensor is faster. I don't have compulsion for it to open in 0.0003 seconds like it has been stressed in the YouTube reviews, it's faster than fast-enough.Battery life is awesome, 3.7k mah. It's like it has a compulsion to stay on. Not at all draining at any point.Sound quality is great too, though stereo could have been better. It's like I'm hearing everything from right or left side, on landscape mode. Anyways I'm either going to use an external speaker or a headset, so no probs.Pricing is great, definitely not overpriced. Phone with this specs are being sold at 10k higher prices or of lower quality of experience, by others, and this phone is built with Users in mind, I can confidently say that, it has many handy utilities.Only problem is something that is not with the phone, actually 2 , a bit overpriced official protective bumper case, and no preferential tempered glass or information about if we need it at all. I got the phone on 2nd November, I still have that out of the box screen cover & case. I couldn't find reliable tempered glass, the Amazon recommended are not fitting the phone screen, and their choice have changed twice in 3 days 😄 . So I've ordered 3 of them 😁 let's see which will fit, I'll return the other 2.The protective bumper case is 2k, though it's official it can easily be priced 500rs below (don't say, you can buy the 1.2k priced one right? Both are a bit overpriced. You are great at what you do, you don't have to take pricing decisions like other phonemakers, your flagship is an example for that) And also to OnePlus guys, so many fake reviews in this area. You have to intervene, your product's accessories are being spammed by fake-reviewed Tglass sellers. Better you soon release your own tempered glass. Got the promo code and getting the bullets headphone in a day's time. A small help from a beneficiary. Keep up the good work OnePlus.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"OnePlus is the best when it comes to performance in Android. Much better than the pixel phones, which is a shame. I was using OP5 before this for a year and a half before I shattered the screen. So I decided to go for 6t now. To be honest I didn't want to buy a new phone since the old one worked as good as new with no slow downs.Coming to 6t, this is a powerhouse. Never faced a hiccup in any apps, the camera is above average, but I'm not a photography enthusiast. Gaming performance is epic! And it charges extremely fast thanks to Dash charging.The only downside to this phone is the slightly slower finger print sensor. You'll notice it if you're coming from older OnePlus devices, which had a lightening fast sensor. But it's nothing you can't get used to.The notch is one of the most subtle ones on the market.I would recommend this phone to anyone who's looking for a new Android device.

Mirror black finish also hides the fingerprints to some extent which is also good. Performance and fluid Ness is something which has hooked me for first time for using OnePlus devices.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first OnePlus phone and boy am I surprised how good it is. Here are few things I have found after 5 days of usage:Pros:1. Great Camera - The camera is awesome in this phone. I have attached few pics taken from this phone and they look great. The color reproduction is not exactly 100 percent but very close. The images turn out a little bit more colorful than they actually are but they look really good. Selfies in portrait mode are very good and even without the portrait mode they look great. The profession mode is wonderful if you can take some time learning how to use it. The pic of the mango that I have posted was taken in the professional mode. The HDR mode produces good evenly lit pictures - the pic of pink flowers against the sky background and the night mode is a great add on. Videos in 4k 60fps are stunning. This in fact is one of the very few phones out there which can record 4k at 60fps which is usually something that most pricey flagship phones are capable of. There is one thing to be noted here though that the video length cannot be more than 5 minutes. I purchased this phone for the camera and it has not disappointed me ever.2. Good Battery life - With some 4 hours of music listening, 1 hour of browsing and youtube videos, the phone drains by around 70% in 14 hours. The charging is fast.3. Speed - The Phone is very responsive and smooth. Haven't played games yet on it but am sure the phone would be able to handle that with ease. It feels like a fast phone.4. Permium feel - The phone is a little heavier than other phones of almost the same size so feels solid and premium. While some people might feel the lighter the phone is the better it is, it's my personal opinion that a slightly heavier phone feels good.5. Screen - The screen is bright and has stunning clarity.Cons:1. The in-screen fingerprint sensor - This is kind of the weakest link. The finger print sensor is slow. It feels slower than some of the sub 20000 phones out there. Of course this kind of comparison is like apples and oranges because this is an in-screen sensor and I am comparing it with the sensors at the back but still. It feels slow. The face recognition though is zippy and very fast.2. No provision for 3.55 mm jack. So you cannot listen to songs while charging the phone(Unless you have bluetooth headphones of course)Apart from these two things the phone is pretty much complete and at the price at which it is available now, definitely worth the money.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the phone on the 1/11/2018. I have purchased one plus 6 on 24/08/18. When I had received my OnePlus 6 and started using it my joy was countless. After years of tradition of using Moto phones I upgraded here. The OnePlus 6 is a seamless ph with many good things. Within months I upgraded to OnePlus 6t. OnePlus 6 and OnePlus 6 t are basically the same phone. It's not much worth upgrading. Both has oxygen 9, same camera, even night mode is available here. Comparatively 6 is lighter and can be held better in hands than 6t. Software no difference. Difference is battery n minimum storage, Tear drop notch. Overall the pH cannot be compared with anyone. It's a giant in itself. Smooth touch, good camera, fast touch responses, everything is very nice. It is difficult cto bring the experience in writing. It should be felt. It's worth to use the phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"So this is my first time writing a review about anything , normally i read and watch reviews given by other people but this phone is getting a lot of criticism .The reason might be the design the not change in hardware and other things.But people don't realize that this phone was not made for the people who owned the one plus 6 ,it was for the people who were upgrading form a one plus 3 or 3t or 5 .Me being a user of one plus 3t absolutely love one plus foe their software and hardwarewhen they had launched the one plus 3t it was not a major upgrade over the 3 but a phone for the people who were looking to move into the one plus ecosystem ,it had the same design and almost the same specs (sanpdragon 821).Now coming back to the main topic the reviewthe design is a minor upgrade over the last modelas the notch is smaller and there is no headphone jack (the hardest of choices require the strongest of wills)i don't mind the removal of headphone jack as i really wanted to buy the one plus wireless bullets but they are still not available and I had to buy the type c bullets instead of them.The hardware is good but could have been better i.e in the camera they could have given a secondary wide angel lense .the haptic feedback could be better .Now the software we all now that oxygen os is one of the greatest crearion of one plus as it is optimized and snappy at the same time but there the are few things that i would like inculded in the software like manual video mode and a refresh ti the text message app.Now there are some things that i love to the use of Android pi , the inscereen finegeprint , night mode .There are also a few tiny deatils lik if you chek incoming vibration pattern they have new names for every pattern .This one plus always holds a special place in my heart and i absolutely love this phone and i would recommend this if you're looking for an update( but not an update over the 6 )

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Being a tech savvy person, I have owned a Galaxy S3, iPhone 6 and was using a Galaxy S8 until I replaced it with a OnePlus 6T. It was my first experience of trying a smartphone out of my comfort zone (a samsung or an apple).OnePlus 6T has met all my standards• Premium phone (both look and feel) at the best price• Screen resolution is good• The battery life is amazing. To be exact, I watched Brooklyn 99 for an entire day (10 hours) on the Netflix app• The processing speed is mind blowing. 0 lag• Camera both front and rear are super amazing with potrait modes. Night feature for night photography takes time to process but I'll say the picture is worth the waitNothing can be perfect, some negatives• On screen fingerprint takes time to open and struggles to work with dirt on the screen or a fat tempered glass• Night feature takes a lot of time to process the photo• No health app to monitor the steps. In-built pedometer is something I look for in a smartphone• Phone is heavy but battery life compensates the struggleI am really happy with the phone and would suggest most of you to buy it. It'll be foolish right now (November, 2018) and spend that kind of money to buy an apple, a samsung or a pixel unless you are a die hard fan of those smartphone. I respect your opinion.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"It is a very amazing device just i would say , it's not a very big upgrade from last device bt still it's very good , the best in market , 1 star has been reduced just because of headphone jack as everyone wants a headphone jack , maximum people i mean.  Quality of the product is good , battery life is also good and charging speed is best in class .  Camera is also very good and competes against the best of other flagships. Just go for it in this price range , no other phone can be better. 4 stars because there is always a space of improvement and no device is perfect.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"If this is what OnePlus are going to offer then I am sold. I think the phone looks absolutely stunning and yet not flashy, it's understated good looks gives it that upmarket feeling. You don't get a flagship device at this rate. I don't change phones frequently so this phone will be with me for atleast 3 years and as it is my first OP device so I will keep it with me. So next Oneplus will be 9 or 10 God willing. But I tested the bullet headphones and they are good but can be much improved. If possible do bring back the headphone jack and led notification. Great Job OP and Amazon.

Total available space will get is 113 GB out 128GB. You have OTG support. The Oxygen OS is terrific with customization. Will be having a default applied screen protector and also back case which is good available in box.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought 2 phones (one in Nov. 2018 and the 2nd one on Jan. 2019) from Amazon.  The new Oneplus Avtar will certainly satisfy those users who can compromise with the loss of headphone jack and  notification led. The usb C- headphone jack adapter is in noway an alternative. Similarly, people will expect a stereo speaker on a phone of this price range -- even Poco F1 and Asus Zenfone 5Z provide it at a much lower cost. Yes, 6t offers a lot of excellent features: its superb display, flagship hardware, software, excellent performance, great camera and, to some extent, good battery life, but the loss of some useful feature will deter many potential buyers accustomed with headphones and notification light. Here are some pros and cons of OP6t:Pros:1. A flagship with excellent looks and built quality.2. Great optic AMOLED display with superb viewing angle.3. Flagship Snapdragon 845 processor with 6GB RAM (with excellent RAM Management) makes it one of the fastest (if not the fastest) phone available in India.4. Latest android with butter smooth OS5. Great cameras, which become superb after recent updates. Back Camera takes excellent photos some of which are  even better than those takes with Google Pixel, iphone and to some extent Samsung Note 9.6. Specific Pixel 3 camera mod has now been made available for OP6t and tested it on my phone. Results are easily comparable.7. Great battery life; for my case with moderate use it lasts more than 2 days. Charging from 0 to 100% takes less than 1.5 hrs.8. Fast face unlocking capability.9. Very good call quality and connectivity.Cons:1. No headphone jack and notification LED.2. Fingerprint sensor is slower than that in OP6 although authentication process is accurate.3. Sound quality is good but does not match with the stereo speakers of the cheaper Asus Zenfone 5z or even Poco Fi.4. Only a single base version colour option (mirror black) both front and back sides of which are fingerprint magnets.

Same 845 processor as one plus 6. Well this is latest and they didn't have any option6. The phone is not dust or water resistant. That's bad OnePlus7. Price of the phone is slightly higher (should have been 3-4 k less)All in all this phone is an all-rounder.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely top notch phone!!! No need for big reviews with pros and cons. Just know that the pros are almost everything and cons are mostly limited to minor s/w bugs. This Onpelus keeps fixing very fast with OTA updates. Previously my only issue was that of Android OS updates as Oneplus was very slow or never pushed updates. This comes with the latest version of android and hoping for faster updates in the future.Battery life is legendary... Getting close to 6 hrs of SOT nd that's just phenomenal.Camera is great, may not compete with the pixel but who wants to anyway. At the price its just great.Lack of a headphone jack is a definite letdown but keep the in box dongle fixed to your existing earphones or upgrade to some good Bluetooth headsets during sale.Have not seen any major issues yet and performance is very smooth and super fast.The animations may feel a bit too buttery for some, in such cases go for changing animation scale in the developer options.Overall fantastic ...

5.0 out of 5 stars,"My sister is not a tech savvy person. She didn't want to spend a lot of money. Her iPhone broke twice. So she was sick and tired, asked me for a suggestion and we purchased this for her. Right off the bat, the setup process was easier than expected. All her contacts came through immediately, she found the phone big but not so big that she could not handle it. She was initially worried about using such a big phone but now almost 2 months later, she never even talks about her iPhone. She is a person who works daily and has to report her location to her bosses sometimes working late till 1-2AM and this phone works perfect for her. The screen though it is not as gorgeous as a Samsung s9, it has its own advantages. The customisation, battery life, the fact that this comes with a case, the ease of use have all won my sister over and maybe she will never go back to iOS. For this reason, I want to give the phone a perfect 5 stars. I personally use a s9 plus but if I had to go to a different phone, it would be either the Mate 20 Pro or this. Why not? Did I say it is delightful that this ships with inbuilt 128GB? AMAZING.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was using 3T from past 2 years and my experience was Good, But this phone is not working fine, it hangs a lot and I can see a black and white screen with dots on it often. The camera quailty is okish because you see grains in the backcamer images which is annoying. I am not happy with this Product. The fact that this is a new piece and it hangs a lot bothers me because it has not been a month also. the fingure print scanner is also not that great 3t was way more better.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a 6GB, 128GB phone. I m using the dual camera lens for the first time and noticed some objects getting out of focus in the auto mode. Sound quality is same as before with very little improvement. However, OLED display is certainly good with natural colors. The phone came with pre attached screen guard which absorbs lot of prints requiring frequent cleaning. In screen fingerprint sensor works well. Face recognition is snappy. One plus phones are fast and don't lag like Samsung/Iphone even after 2 years of use.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Camera is not good, face recognition does not work always always asks for finger print or password ,where  finger print also doesn't work properly, always have to use password for screen lock.The phn gets stuck every now and then ,while typing or using any app, have to screen lock it and open it again,the screen minimization from swipe is not good at all (even though copied from iPhone not at all able to reach there). Many gestures don't work on lock screen which are supposed to work on lock screen. Many other issues are there,when I wanted to return , voila😀 there is no  return policy for this on Amazon. what they do is only replacement of same phn,same model, same colour, everything same ...ifff there is any physical damage. This is what I got response from Amazon customer care. They don't care if the phn is not good.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:Superb battery life...streches to 7hrs of screen on time..on heavy usage 5.5 to 6 hrs screen on time.Camera quality...well lets just say its good but for the price range,its mediocore...but most of us wont even notice the difference. Though the slow motion is cool but its of zero use at night.Built quality....extremely good and feels premium to hold.I went fir tge mirror back edition,though what they say is true,it is a smudge magnet.but still tuck it in a tpu clearcase and it it looks awesome.Sound quality...its one of the best i used till date..its so loud that that my room mates have grown to hate it :Dcoming to the display...well it okay sort...my previous op3t had a better display than this...*on comparing op6,op6t and op3t hands on..i'd op3t was the best followed by op6 and then op6t! The coloyrs are much vibrant on the previous two even when kept on same settings(default screen calibration).It takes exact 1hr and 27 mins to charge from 0 to 100...same as op6...despite having a bigger battery.Ummm what else....Yeah...the finger print sensor...i know its slow as comoared to the traditional finger print sensor...but God its so cool..the difference is notocable for people coming from one plus line.But the lag of 0.20s is acceptable...with the contant ota ipdates the fingerprint sensor has seem to gather up speed and seems to open much faster..Its open 8 out of 10 times i try..but with face unlock on..you wont even notice the delay of 0.20s...But belive me...it is fast...damn fast as comoared to the other phones out in the market...tested it against vivo v11 pro.. verdict: op6t blows it out of the park.Oxygen Os...has gone to a whole different level with gestures 2.0. add 8gb of ram and a snapdragon 845...you just glide from one app to the other...buttery smooth...they werent lying when they cam up with the advertisement for op6t!!!Cons:The nightscape mode is more of like a hit and miss thing...at lowest it will give you an image with 0 enhancement...but whennit does it job,it produces fairly good images..but at the cost of sharpness.Headphone jack....well i miss it..i often hate the fact that i need to unplug the charger  to listen to music or watch a video at the end of the day.The weight is noticable...my op3t was about 155gms...op6t is now 185gms...so i constantly realise when i pick up the phone...dang this is heavy!!!It is a tad bit narrower than op6 about 0.5mm and with the screen size being so large..its seems like a long glowing rod at night!Also since the screens are rounded at the corners there is loss in pixel and video content...you will notice it much clearly while playing pubg...afterall the game has more buttons than a nascar car!If you have any questions,do ask!

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I always wanted to have OnePlus phone and when they announced 6T, then I made up my mind that I will buy this phone.I got it without pre-booking offer so no type c bullet earphones. But hats-off to Amazon for the before the time delivery again.Now for phone -1. New in-screen fingerprint sensor - Very slow as compare to normal fingerprint sensor.2. Battery - 3700mAh makes difference and with proper use you can get approx 1 day of charge time.3.  Notch - Tear drop notch is good as compared to other notch sizes and you get more screen size.No major or unknown issue yet discovered, its a good phone in this range.My rating - 9/10

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The display is bright and has got some really good colors. Sound quality is decently loud(just be careful not to cover up your speaker). Since I got my hands on my phone day before yesterday, I haven't given it a rest. After a day's use with reasonable screen brightness(about 75%) and screen on time just above 5 hours, I ended up with 50% juice left. And the warp charging speed is just as promised. I was surprised to see that the battery drained only up to 3% over night. Nightscape in the stock camera is not as good as that in the pixel 3. But I downloaded the pixel 3 gcam mod and it's working just fine.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I’ve had the OnePlus 6T for a good month now and I think it’s time for a review of the device.Some background – I wouldn’t call myself a fanboy but I’ve owned all OP phones except for the 3 series. I find their performance to budget ration incredible and while they’ve had problems till OP2 with mediocre hardware, OP5 was the best android experience I’ve had in quite a bit. Then they followed up with the 6 which stuttered a bit out of the box, but they’ve managed to iron out the kinks and now is definitely close to the Pixel when it comes to usability. No hyperbole.Anyway, coming to this phone, it is definitely one of the best android phones out in the market at this time. The 6 was a good step forward, but I wanted to wait for the 6T and so got this instead. Pretty much everyone here has talked about the specs and the water drop front camera, so I’ll talk about quality of life with this device for over the period.The exterior has never been exposed to the elements owing to the silicone cover that came bundled with the phone. It is a gorgeous looking device with typical OP design hints. People have always asked me what OP device it is – meaning OP has already established itself as one of the better looking manufacturers of mobile phones.The camera is fantastic. I have attached a few images but you can’t make out the difference when the resolutions is scaled down. If I’m being brutally honest, I’d say this is still a few notches below the big players, Pixel and iPhone X. But it’s good enough to blow almost any other phone out of the water.One Plus is a fantastic brand and I urge you to give it a shot – for me, it has been one of the best Android experiences ever.

What does the package contain:1) Charger adapter and cable2) 3.5mm jack convertor3)  A nice and firm back caseNote that the phone also comes with the screen guard pre applied which I find great as we don't have to order it separately and most importantly get rid of the pain of applying it.Cons:1) camera: great picture quality and software with handy modes- now some people will say they could find a even more better camera with pixel but they tend to forget the price difference.2) battery: it comes with 3700mah battery which easily covers an entire day for me with high screen usage.3) Finger print sensor :istantly unlocks4) sound quality is also very good and will never disappoint anyone.Cons:Nothing except the headset..it would be a perfect package if one plus can include headset along with the box..

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oneplus 6T is absolutely gorgeous. For the price range, no other device can outperform the Oneplus. Looking so premium, perform amazingly fast literary no logo can be seen any of the normal apps its loads in a blink of eye when the finger tip once touches the icon. Camera is very appreciable but not upto the performance of highend flagships like pixel or IPhone Xs, but it does a very reasonable job for the money we are paying. Many reviews can be seen that the speakers are not stereo and its bad, i don't think so, its loud and clear. The Android PIE customised OxygenOS is good and neat which gives a feel like stock android while its perfectly customised for so many good features that lacks in many of the stock android smartphones but it should also be noted that Oxygen is not perfect by all means i reported some bugs in the alert slider, downloading huge apps from playstore, headphone ringtone volume issue but hopefully they are giving timely updates hence clearing bugs out of it. Battery is decent, for a device having SD845 and 6 gigs RAM and large Amoled Display a full day is big enough but I am a really heavy user playing PUBG for hours, streaming youtube, browsing, FB, whatsapp, downloads and full time 4G data ON and also have dual sim setup so i need to hit the charger twice a day but the charger is amazingly fast, i just go for a bath or having a snack and back boooyah.. battery charged to more than 75% its enough till i sleep. And finally the Amoled Display, it's not upto the displays of Samsung's Note series or Galaxy series but trust me its really nice, the tear drop notch and very thin chin and bezels gives makes the display more appealing, i put a decent beach wallpaper from Wallpapers Craft and sometimes i can't take my eyes from the display its so satisfying for the eye's. Indisplay Fingerprint scanner works fast with a nice animation, and the lack of headphone jack and wireless charging i don't care about it.

It also has a very good battery backup and can easily go upto 1.5 days at least with day long internet browsing and video streaming and music.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Writing this review after using the OnePlus 6T around a month. I boutgh 8GB/256GB, Midnight black Model. Following are the pros and cons, I observed:Pros:-Speed is really fast.-Smooth and user friendly operating system.-Premium look.-Excellent screen and colours.-Best in class camara.-Full battery charge in 60 mins. In normal usage battery lasts around 30 hours.-Company provided fast charger.-Company provided mobile cover which is quite decent. I am using the same cover and it really holds the premium aesthetics of the phone.-Phone has 8 GB RAM but it does not get heat while charging or on excess use.Cons:-I did not like the sound quality at the high volume. It loses voice clarity on full volume.-Difficult to use without a cover, it's too slippery.-Slightly on a heavier side phones.-Auto Brightness does not give good results while watching videos. You have to increase Brightness manually.-3.5 audio jack not there.-Phones in peer companies provide front flash as well, which is not in this phone. Though it uses screen light for the same feature but that's not as effective.Hope you find this review useful. Don't forget to like it :)

(except Camera - which I hope will get better in future).Samsung just cannot compete with the performance and endurance of OnePlus.Although Samsung phones feel more premium in the hand, but everything else in OnePlus far outweighs the lack of supreme build quality.A good decision for sure!

Compared to 3T's aluminium body 6T is all glass which is very fragile. 6T is bulky like hell. Battery life is very good. On my normal usage it lasts around 2 days.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Had to return the entire handset due to faulty charger. The replacement unit was good. Phone was compared with iphone 6s and Honor 10. In all aspects it is better than iPhone 6s and even iphone 8 in some aspects but speed wise it was same as Honor 10. The image quality is same as on the honor 10 in some cases honor 10 images were better. Video picture quality i felt was better on H10 but the overall stabilisation is much better on Oneplus 6t. Where it beats the h10 is the selfie camera. Battery life slightly less than H10 due to screen size. Screen quality is only slightly better than H10. If this helps.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using 15 days these are my observations.Speed wise it is very good as it have 8GB Ram with Snapdragon processor. Look wise its very nice and design and quality of the material is good. When come to Fingerprint the animations are looking fabulous while unlocking but some times not capturing for 2 or 3 sec then giving no detected message. Need improvement there. Coming to camera need more improvements overall. The one option I am regret is clicking picture only by using the capture button. As my moto g2 have full screen capture option and g4 have fingerprint to click option with screen. But here we don't have any fingerprint option also so sometimes while taking selfies for large group its very difficult to capture using the only button. Same time by using earphones also we are not able to capture images. Need software improvement there.Coming to calls while taking with earphones we are unable to mute the call by using earphones. Which is there for my all previous phones which are very low budget ones. While taking client calls it is making very uncomfortable because I am used to earphone play/pause button to mute the call.Coming to network while in call the internet or messages option is not working. Internet usage my be restricted while in call but the messages option need to be improved. Because in some urgent call if some one calls we need message them back saying so.Overall its good to use but need some really cool improvements software wise.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Over the past couple of years, every phone that OnePlus has made has indeed been incrementally better than the previous one it makes. That can be traced back from the time the OnePlus 3T succeeded the OnePlus 3—which was already a very good phone at the time. This unflinching consistency has paid dividends here too. The OnePlus 6 was already a great phone to own, and the subtle changes make the OnePlus 6T even better in many respects—the foremost being the new Android on board, and the improved camera. The thing is, if you have already invested in a OnePlus 6, you really don’t need to rush to buy the 6T. But for anyone else looking for a genuine upgrade over their existing phone, this is ticking off all the boxes.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The OnePlus 6T is undeniably the most advanced and accomplished phone from the company till now. The OnePlus 6 is still good, but the 6T gives it a boost in the battery department and a fancy way to unlock at a perfect price.The display is a 6.41-inch AMOLED panel having 19.6:9 aspect ratio. Thanks to its 85.6% screen to body ratio, the phone doesn’t feel large in hand despite the big screen size.There’s no upgrade in the display resolution this time as well. It has a full HD (2340 x 1080p) display with 402ppi pixel density. But in all honesty, the AMOLED display on the OnePlus 6T still offers gorgeous picture quality. The colors pop, it looks immersive and there’s no compromise with the details.The back of the phone is relatively cleaner, as there is only the camera setup since the fingerprint is moved under the display. On the right edge of the phone is a power on button, which is one of your options for waking the device – the other is a double tap on the screen - and above that is the signature OnePlus slider that allows you to mute your phone with a quick flick.OnePlus has done splendid enhancements in their smartphone design over the years. But of all the designs, the OnePlus 6 looked like their most premium work till date and that’s a constant on the OnePlus 6T. The company uses a 3D glass back on the phone which looks great without compromising with the essentials.GOODGreat battery lifeFluid performanceTop-end designImpressive rear cameraBADNo headphone jack'Only' full HD resolutionNo microSD card slot

5.0 out of 5 stars,"It took almost 2 weeks for Flipkart to deliver my phone. the bullet earphones are really nice. the is good at performance but oxygen os needs some improvements like when a group message notification is shown it highlights the phone number of a contact rather than the group name. so we might misunderstand its a message from some unknown number if the contact isn't saved in the phone. Regarding the active display, the os could be tuned to show a preview of notification shown, when selected on that icon in active displayFurther cons are regarding the sound quality.... there are no dual stereo speakers and the single speaker could be easily blocked with our hands in landscape mode. the night portrait mode is not up to expectation... and cameras are average. the phone is slightly overpriced too. the mirror black version is too slippery on hands but with the case provided its fine.Regarding cons, the battery backup is excellent, charging is fast...0-100% battery in slightly more than an hour.

Everything was very good with this phone except the picture quality but then I just put GCam version from XDA for One plus and viola more information get pixel quality pics.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second OnePlus phone, after a very bad experience with the previous one and I took it on the hope they have learnt lessons and improved, but it isn't, it's again the same worst feeling. I don't know how to call it flagship killer it's actually a flagship loser.1* rating is for the following reasons:Camera: A35K flagship phone which only takes pics in one mode. It so worse that even the basic modes and stickers are missing. The camera does not even allow to change resolution (Megapixel), even a 5K phone does that. I went through some forums and people suggested to use Google camera or other third-party camera apps.Screen Quality: The phone came with pre-installed screen guard (off course with bubbles and a warning to only use official screen guard for the finger print to work properly), just wondering why does a flagship killer need a 100 Rs worth (or 20 Rs Chinese equivalent) screen-guard?  Prospective buyers just think of it, is it because of poor screen quality? cost cutting? Please note I spent exactly 6200 Rs to replace the screen of my first One plus phone, which again cracked 2nd time, after which I totally discarded the phone. One plus hasn’t yet learned the lesson and again released a phone with substandard screen quality.Dust-Finger print Magnet: The back is made of Mirror back, it attracts not just dust but is a serious finger print magnet. Keep it on table for 2 min or hold it just for 1 min after thoroughly cleaning with a  soft cloth, it turns dirty in no time. The pre-installed screen guard also attracts too much dust. Why does a manufacturer himself give a free a back case, why? Just think of it, before purchasing.Low Battery Capacity: 3700 mAh is too low for a phone with such a specification.Poor Battery Backup: The battery backup is not so good, losing 20-30% battery overnight in idle mode. My Normal usage in a day 30-40 min calls, 1-2 hours of apps usage, 1-2 hours of music and 15-20 mins of forward videos without any games, battery hardly lasts.Poor Service Quality and expensive repair costs: One plus service quality is too poor, in hand experience from my first phone. They have hardly 2-3 proper service centres in big cities, the Queue's and waiting times are long and on top the spares or screen replacement costs are exorbitantly high. Just enquire the screen replacement costs from service centre before buying this phone.Free Labour: Please don't be a free labour to OnePlus. For every issue with OnePlus, you have to go through 10's of forums (including the official OnePlus forum) 100's of threads and 1000's of replies from other users and find out yourself how to fix the issue. On top of it we provide free feedback (actually free labour) so that they improve their next one. Just think of it are you buying a phone or doing a free labour ship to OnePlus, why Should we waste our time and money to do something, which one plus should do themselves?

Never did it fall below 30% after a complete day's normal use.ii) The SAR reports (Read Radiation from the phone) -recently seems to be of concern - 'The Xiaomi Mi A1 recorded the highest SAR at 1.75, followed by the OnePlus 5T at 1.68, the Xiamo Mi Max 3 at 1.58, the OnePlus 6T at 1.55, and the HTC U12 Life at 1.48""iii) Camera is good 3.5/5 . But it could have been even better(in low lights)After having used one plus 2(still using) past 3 years, I just fell in love for one plus phones.their performance and build quality are superior. I just wanted to upgrade and waited to buy 6T since one plus 6 is being talked about.I did know that 6T should be there any time soon.And finally got this elegant beast!Have been using past two days.. trust me, it's a killer of the lot.Superior user experience.Great face recognition, even in low lightFinger print sensor is super fastAwesome smooth graphics..App drawer, App switching etc.Negligible Bezel , Will create more screen spaceMidnight Black suggested, for  lesser fingerprint marks.Battery life is great,with dash charge

The real deal is the display,, I'm loving it.. 🥰Will update later after testing this beast for a week.Edit:-I think the phone wifi has some software problem, because it does not download things on playstore or even update certain applications during 1st attempt ( turning it off and on again & again ). I think it can be fixed with a software update.Rest All:--No more complaint. This is beast and works flawlessly.

Oneplus really never hesitate to innovate, was little worried while buying the OnePlus 6T , thought it would be large in hands as it's 6.41' , But when I opened the package and hold it in my hands , its was a feeling that you have the best of best tech in hands, it's amazing to see the form factor that OnePlus 6T came up with. It's one of best flagship OnePlus 6T ever built. Go for it , believe me you won't regret and there won't be any company atleast in 2019 which would be coming with a more Impressive design than that of OnePlus 6T.No Matter what Apple and samsung would do , they won't be able to deliver such an impressive designed handset!Features :-1) Good looking2) Best Design3) screen unlock4) wow charger5) back cover provided by OnePlus 6T........................................All Wow Phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would start with 'WOW' while buying phone I was very much in thoughts I should go for it or not. But trust me best decision I would have ever made for buying the phone. Awesome picture quality with loads of camera options to go for, bokeh mode, night mode, potrait mode and pro cam option.Sound is decent and as expected from any flagship killer phone, quality which u even get in iPhone which you buy for 1lac or 80k. So why not put 40 and get yourself best.BATTERY LIFE is the section you would appreciate the most I start my day with 99% and ends up with 60% remaining, yeah I know people have there own way of using phone and I totally agree with that as when I play PUBG previously I had to charge my phone after 3 full games which I can play at least 8 games in full now. Whoe let's not forget the best part of charging. With the dash charger it charges 0 to 100 in merely 1hour and 15 mins.Yes many would miss 3.5mm Jack for headphones but oneplus fixes that by providing c type converter to 3.5mm in box so no need to worry and my suggestion is Bluetooth headset which is trend at the moment.So afterall I am really satisfied with the phone I will complete 30days of usage tomorrow. But I can still find my phone fresh as bought today.And thanks to amazon for timely and carefully delivery of phone to my doorstep.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before I write something about the phone or its specs, I would like to say I keep changing smartphone and usually I buy in range of 10K-15K however, since last 1 year no smartphone was fascinating me apart from POCO F1 but already being a MI user ( 6 MI phones used since last 5 years) and few cousins already owning it,  It didn't allow me to buy same. But, I was more concern with the price and then I started searching a lot about all the latest smartphone who has Snapdragon 845 SOC I ended up my search on One Plus 6T.Today, I'm happy enough to share this review after using the device for 3 months. All I would say if you have a budget of 30K then spend some more and go for One Plus 6T as of now.Now Lets talk about pros and cons:Pros:Great battery life With super fast chargingAmazing performance and smart boost featurePremium design with shining glassImpressive rear and front camera with good quality low light capturingIn display fingerprint scanner is really fast and I Love the cosmos effectNo heating at all, I m a pubg lover too.Cons:No headphone jack but you'll get a converter, I wished they could provide ear plug directly instead of converter.No notification LED lightsNo microSD card slot but Its okay I m not much storage guy 128GB is more than enough for me.The major one for me atleast, PRICE I know its a flagship device but I want this at 30KRating as per the usage of last 3 months so far.Weight: 9/10OS: 9/10Screen quality: 9/10CPU: 10/10Performance: 10/10Storage: 10/10 (113 gb almost)Battery: 9/10Rear camera: 9/10Front camera: 8/10In display fingerprint scanner: 9/10Face unlock: 8/10Thanks.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"What an amazing device. The price is justified what it offers. Believe me it may not be a better looking phone out there among the flagships, but I bet it's a better phone to live with compared to others, the reason being the polished software. It's a low priced pixel, with more functionality. The super slow motion is great. The notch in fact is it's beauty spot. Display is great. Camera good. In display finger print reader works like a charm. Battery life amazing. Personally my only complaint is huge size of the phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one of the best phone, after using iPhone for good 4 years, MI for 2 years it was time to try for something new. This time i decided to go with Oneplus that too 6t, i rate it at 5on 5 there are reasons to it.1. Handy - phone / keypad should always be top priority and its spot on.2. Picture and sound quality - it's far beyond the expectations , i do own DSLR from 10 years and understand the importance of the pictures very well. Shooting instantly , clicking in low lights , depth of pic has been few things which I see image as and OnePlus 6t will never disappoint you.Battery and unlocking power- it lasts for complete day after heavy usage and after the updates the face unlocking has improved dramatically.Thanks OnePlus.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"A month before I purchased this phone from amazon.in. It is a good phone with great battery backup and also quickly charges for which I like this phone very much. The phone never get hangs or heats at all. Display quality is good. Camera quality is average. Youtube videos misguides people as it's camera is shown great there but actually image quality of selfie camera is poor and very cheap. Even vivo v11 pro has much better selfie camera with lot of details and also costs you nearly half price than one plus 6t. You can also face some software lags in OnePlus. Phone is little bit heavier but ok. However built quality of handset is good.Overall it is not a good value for money. As phone and it's accessories are bit costly. I personally recommend you to go with vivo v11 pro, Samsung A8 or go with Vivo nex or iphone and don't spend on this phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best in every aspect. One Plus really never Settles. I have been using this phone for about 20+ days and overall my impression of it has been super positive.1. Battylife really deserves the number one spot. Being a super haevy user( I play PUBG a lot) the phone still manages to give me 5+ hours of screen on time. For a normal user it will last easily for about 1.5 days on a single full charge.2. Display is sharp, crisp and colourful. Not as good as my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 but still it won't disappoint. Way better than my One Plus 3T. I can say it's the best Full HD+ display on any phone right now. And that water droplet NOTCH. I love it.3. Build quality is purely a flagship level. Phone feels ultra premium. It looks as beautiful as my Note 8. The phone sandwiched between gorilla glass 6 just blows me away. It's really beautiful.4. Performance wise it's somewhat similar to one plus six as they both share a common processor. Nevertheless, no complaint, thumbs up. As they say, Speed and yeah it really is speed. Super snappy and powerful. No issues playing PUBG, game run super smooth.5. Though it's a single firing speaker, but it's definitely loud and clear. Way better than my Note 8 and 3T.6. Sound quality of calls is crisp, clear.7. Camera, is fine for me. There is no comparison with Note 8 as it clearly tears it apart but still, 8/10 for the camera for sure. Does every thing that I can expect from a camera and it out performed Note 8 in some areas as well. But still, thumbs up, as I said, it does all the work. So no issues whatsoever.P.S. : I really miss the headphone jack. RIP to the good old one plus devices that featured a headphone jack. :)

5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are many reviews from users as well as reviewers out there. Just my 2 cents:Pros:Incredible Battery life with the fastest charging system on the market.Screen is vibrant and has various colour modes to suit your preference.Performs like a champ with gaming loads such as Pubg and Asphalt.Slim and light though mandatorily needs a case as most of the construction is glass .Camera is a hit and miss sometimes, highly recommend the Pixel 3 camera app port. When it works well, the pictures are fantastic.Cons:Some minor bugs such as the accelerometer requires a shake sometimes to get orientation.The bokeh mode is a hit and miss with recognizing faces and objects.Build quality is top notch (Heh!) but fragile.If you're used to a 3.5mm jack, you will most certainly miss the jack.Never cared about wireless charging so that didn't really matter to me.Mono speaker.It may have a list of niggles but it will most definitely make you smile when you use it and still at the end of the day have 40% battery left.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Using this phone for week now.Mark my words ""I use my phone heavily"". I play a lot of games and the battery is amazing. I leave my house with full charge at 7am and I return around 9pm and I would still have 20% left which is amazing considering how much I use my phone.The only area where the phone isn't good at is the FINGERPRINT. The fingerprint fails to recognise at times but if u have face unlock, U don't have to use the fingerprint. The face unlock is so fast that by the time you place ur finger on the fingerprint, it would have unlocked the phone.All other features are fine and amazing.Please don't compare it with the flagships from Samsung or Apple. I mean to say this phone lags behind those flagships in areas like camera, IP ratings and a few other features.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best investments I have made so far.Let's start with the Pros first:-1) Build Quality:- For 38k the built quality is amazing. You get that premium feel as soon as you hold the phone in your hands.2) Screen Quality:- The screen quality is good. Better than the IPS LCD displays used on Asus Zenfone  5z. Colours are very punchy and the display is very crisp.3) Battery Life:- This is the biggest pro of this device. The 3700mah battery lasts easily for one and a half to 2 days on heavy usage. It can easily last for 3 days on medium usage. The best part is that we have the amazing OnePlus Dash charger. It takes 1hr 28mins to charge from 0 to 100%.4) Oxygen OS:- The Best thing about OnePlus is their fast and fluid UI. It's very close to stock Android which makes the device very snappy. You do not notice any lagg whatsoever.5) In-display Fingerprint:-The USP of OnePlus 6T. Trust me the the fingerprint is very very fast. You can't compare it with that Vivo device which first came with this technology.Now the Cons:-1)No headphone jack:- Not a deal breaker but it might be annoying for people who use wired headphones.2)No Stereo speakers:- The sound output from the speaker is loud enough but considering the price of this device they should have provided stereo speakers.3)No LED Notification Light:- I don't understand why they removed it. You have to rely on the ambient display always.4) Not so good RAM Management:- I think this is a software bug. I have noticed this several times. Apps like YouTube & Instagram does not stay in memory and reloads. This is quite annoying. Hope they fix this with a software update.5) No Wireless Charging:- They call it ""Flagship killer"" but there's no wireless charging.6)No IP Protection:- It's the 8th ""FLAGSHIP KILLER"" device from OnePlus but still no IP rating.Final Verdict:-If you already have OnePlus 6 or even the 5T, there's no point of upgrading to 6T. Instead you can wait for next 6 months and get your hands on the OnePlus 7.  The OnePlus 7 will come with Snapdragon 855 which will have support for 5G. Also we will see improvements in the camera and it might even come with Stereo speakers and an IP rating.But if you are currently on an old laggy phone with poor UI, battery life, and looking for a premium device but don't want to spend more than 40k, the OnePlus 6T will prove as a very good upgrade.

Its difficult to use it (better go with face unlock). It will be much better only if you add all 10 fingers :-) 3*-Fingerprint scanning is comparatively slow (lot of catchy graphics) and sometimes delayed if a wrong finger was used. 2*-Using without a cover is too risky - the back cover is very slippery . But using a cover the phone looses its identity though.-No AUX port, though a type-C to AUX cable is provided with the pack, carrying it all the time is difficult .overall, its a very nice phone and I'm just getting used to it. So far so good.--UPDATE--I have used the phone for almost 20 days now, here are some more insights on the device---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I got the Type-C bullet headphones after 15 days, but I'm just disappointed because it does not have the class. Its like a cheap headphone you can get for ~300-400 (I got it free, so can't complain though)-I face frequent difficulties in connecting to the Car bluetooth Audio (I use SYNC on FORD).-Battery life and Charging is very good.-Crashed 2 times (seems to be a kernel panic) and rebooted while listening to music with full volume (not sure of  reason)-Gaming experience is one of the best. Never had a glitch.-Low light face detection is not good.-Camera is better if you install Google Camera ( OnePlus camera is not bad)

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Oneplus 6T is a good phone in this price bracket but overall experience of mine with this device after 2 months is not that good as i was expecting because of some basic reasons as follows:1. Pathatic on screen finger scanner. Slow, most of the time not responsive. Just a glittery feature of OnePlus 6T with very poor/slow response.2. Battery life is good but not as good as the picture painted around your head by the Company or OnePlus phones users but yeah! Dash charging is one of the highlight of the phone.3.Service centres and customer support of OnePlus is so pathetic that they just don't care about your concern  and always gives you automated replies even without understanding your concern.At one point you'll feel frustrated with all of this and the backhand customer care team/online support is the real issue for the prospective buyers of the phone or existing users.I hope that no one will face that situation.4. Please do not compare this device with iPhone X or later because apart from dash charging, price, you won't appreciate anything of oneplus 6T.Don't choose OnePlus 6T over iPhone if budget is not the issue.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought mobile minutes after launch, using till date, really impressed with this one. Works like a charm. everyone talks positive content, let me point out few negatives i experienced in this (Not applicable to everyone i guess)....1)The in-display finger print display sometimes takes more time than it has to. so it can be said that a dedicated Finger Print sensor is better than this. Not that in display finger Print sensor is bad, but sometimes not very responsive. and i hate when at night time when i try to unlock and a WHITE BRIGHT SCREEN comes upon to detect my face for face-Unlock (Which can be disabled).2) The Camera quality is not that great AS EXPECTED, but its really good, but i expected a little more clarity.These two are the only Negative points i see. Rest of it, its a wonderful mobile and i'm having a lot of fun using it. i'd say BUY IT, coz there's no way you can get all the features available in this mobile for such a low price while in these days a mobile with high specs comes for a minimum of Rs 60,000. GO FOR IT.NOTE TO ONEPLUS :- Bro, take some time and come up with better looking and thinner bumper cases. Come on dude, we spending for you. My GODDD HUMAN. -_-#PreferSterioSpeakers

The screen is better, the phone is faster (not sure if it is faster than iPhones I mean their Bionic chips are really fast), and the battery is good plus it has dash charging which has its side effects to the battery.

Its evolving very fast Thanks to OnePlus Community.2. Great Unibody Design. Its feels premium.3. Great In-Display Fingerprint (Yeah its new but its great).4. Amazing Battery Life. After minor increment to 3700 mah.5. Best Value of Money to get the ""Flagship Experience"" (Yeah they didn't Bragged about it but still it is The Best Premium Android phone right now)6. Best Camera of what you pay. Its great with some nifty feature like Night mode, lens integrated in Camera App.7. Regular update to at least 2-3 year as promised by Oneplus. ( No other OEM has ever gave ..i means except Apple/Samsung)Cons1. No Headphone jack, yeah with increased battery(from 3400 to 3700) you have to compromise with this.2. No improvement in Camera lens as compare to OnePlus6. But still the best in that price bracket.3. Metal is slippery and tend to get fingerprint very easy. Need to put in cover all the time.Thanks for Reading.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything is good about the phone but the in-display fingerprint sensor is substantially not accurate and consistent. OnePlus should have gone with the physical fingerprint reader and should have waited for the new Qualcomm 3rd gen in-display fingerprint sensor.OnePlus actually made its phone slower with this in-display technology by implementing it too soon.Camera is great as it is always been but the night mode shots are with the night mode is not good at all and infact the normal camera mode in the night will give you better shots as compared to the night mode.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Got the phone last week. Buying this post using One plus 2, 3t, 5t and finally bought this. Was so much excited but ended up feeling cheated. The play store stops downloading apps after sometime, though the internet just works awesome and downloads any size file at the same time from chrome. Got the device replcaed as google & one plus said it might be device issue. But even the NEW DEVICE does not work properly and play store stops downloading apps after sometime. This is very frustrating. Never expected this from one plus.Placed request to return it now. Won't suggest anyone to buy it. Go for something else.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great device. Amazing speed. 8gb ram and superior processor work at lightning fast speed. I play a lot of online games and with this device I can open multiple games without worrying about device slowing down. On my previous phones, the games always caused issues like heating of device, device becoming abnormally slow and rapid battery discharge. This device solved all my issues. I have used fast charging devices as well but the speed of charging of this device is the best among any I have come across till date.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's been a month since I am using it. So here's my findings.Pros:1. Screen is awesome. Notch is so small and fluidic that it doesn't bother and looks cool.2. Fast charger works well. For 100% charge it takes about an hour and battery lasts easily for a whole day.3. Camera quality is just awesome. There are thousands of videos for comparison of camera with other brands, but let me tell you such minor details which you'll get in almost double priced phones, Are those phones worth of money?4. It comes with good quality screen protector and back cover. You can use it directly from the box.Cons:1. I had some issues with camera application. Sometimes it just doesn't work.2. The phone is not light weight.3. In screen finger print looks cool, but it's not very fast. It takes time to unlock the phone. And obviously not very accurate. Sometimes I was forced to go by security PIN to unlock, because it couldn't recognize my finger print.Conclusion:Considering price point, this is the best deal you should go with. Its worth every rupee.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"What a phone! I have been using it since the past few weeks. Here's my experience:Pros:- Battery life for over 16-18 hrs on an average with screen time of 4-5 hrs plus. This is the best I have seen so far, more so impressive with a screen size of 6.4"". So you won't need to charge it during the day mostly. Also, notice a near linear drain until the last juice.- Speed is fantastic. Not seen a single clipping or lag so far. I need to catch on my speed infact ! Games like ashphalt play completely lag free! What more do you want and at this price point ! Hence no need of frequent restarts ! ,😅👍- On screen finger print : Quite unlike many critics, I do not see any issues here. It does take a while to get used to it. Acceptable speed for login/unlock. Its one cool feature to show off,😀-  Dual 4G feature on the 6T is a true icing on the top especially for those who use Jio 4G LTE SIM used as a secondary data.- Display is good with standard 1080 resolution,  but not the best. There are better out there in the market. More so,  with the bundled screen guard, images and videos do not exactly standout like the Samsung's Super AMOLED displays, which I have used before. I my take off the screen guard one day and check out but for now it remains put on the brand new phone!- Camera - Sharp and well above avergae photos with the primary camera. Videos are good but the  audio capture is outstanding. Nightscapebis very  effective. And then there is the pro(manual mode) which is completely customisable, left to your skill with the lens. I have still to get a handle on that one and hence cannot comment as yet.  Secondary camera is also nice. Only,  I have some trouble taking selfies with the slim form factor, and get a feel that I am missing out on the larger frame. I may be mistaken here though.ConsJust a few :- No ""One hand operation""- You miss the headphone socket. OnePlus store sells decent headphone (bullet) with USB C plug. You will need one unless you are happy carrying the discerning coverter.- Status icon list is limited to a few. Not sure why? Is it due to teardrop notch?  You need to mostly go an additional touch to pull down and view the usual list of icons typically on the status bar. I find it slightly inconvenient and irritating.Nothing more to crib about!Overall a great phone from OnePlus!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Battery life is awesome. On heavy usage battery will stand for a day. On minimal usage, battery will stands for easily 2 days. Apart from the DASH charging is awesome. To charge a whole 3700 MAH battery, charging takes around 1 hour 10 minutes. Thanks to DASH charging.Picture quality - it is good when compared to Mobile at this prices ranga. Nightscape mode is good. Oxygen OS updates has been released to make the camera battery.Sound Quality - it's good and can't expect more. Value for Money.Final Tip. Don't compare the OnePlus 6T with Samsung Galaxy s9, Google pixel 3, Apple 8, X, XS. They are really very expensive when compared to OnePlus 6T.  In this budget, OnePlus is the best available option.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have recently bought OnePlus6T and have been using the phone from past few days. Here is my feedback on the phone:Pros:i. Android Pie is smooth in its functionality. The upgrades are definitely adding further improvement to the UI.ii. Camera is the best you can find in any phone. Low light photography is amazing. Front portrait pics are clean and decent. The quality of the photos are incredible and unbeatable with any other phone of the same price range.iii. Battery backup is unbelievable. One time full charge is approximately carrying for 9 hours which includes heavy gaming like PUBG.iv. Snapdragon processor is very fast. Under heavy graphics  HD mode, PUBG is smooth in its gameplay with hardly any lag.v. Dual sim VOLTE support is yet another added advantage with smart wifi switching option.vi. Sound is very high and crystal clear. The speaker is very powerful and mic is also very sensitive.Cons:i. The edges of the phone which are having place for menu, back button are little difficult to access with the case cover (Minimal problem but can be adjusted with)ii. Slight lag in the indisplay finger print sensor (taking little longer than expected) yet fast enough not to lag your work.iii. Ambient display brightness is sometimes unable to adjust in sunlight which may be stressful to the eyesOverall verdict is that the phone is a true definition for a flagship killer.NOTE: I was using Oneplus 3 earlier and my pros and cons are based on the comparision of my previous experiences

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Il try to give a detailed and honest (personal) review of the handset so that people looking to continue with the legacy of OP6T can make a choice. OP6T has not changed much in terms of RAM/ROM/SoC config, as it remains the same as OP6. My device config is 6GB/128GB with Snapdragon 835. The camera config also remains the same so you'd be getting the same pictures with OP6T as you were getting with OP6; apart from a minor s/w update which includes the Nightscape camera. Description as to what it does can be found online, but personally, I don't think it is making much improvement to the pictures that are captured in low light during the night. Another significant change is the display, as it contains the waterdrop notch instead of the boat-shaped notch, and also has a higher screen to body ratio as compared to the OP6. The result is a bigger screen and a viewing experience that is much better and less distracting than the OP6. The loss is that the company had to strip the LED notifications to make the notch smaller. I was not really that addicted to LED notifications, so it did not really make any difference to me. So if summed up, the display is something in which Id like to give the company some credit points for making a beautiful AMOLED display in 38K. Moving further, the major change which highlighted the device all during the launch - the inscreen fingerprint scanner. It is quite intuitive and an interesting concept, but I would say that it is still a territory for flagship manufacturers that need to be researched and improvised before it is made public. Again, as I said it is very intuitive and you'd be kind of amazed by the tech put behind it, but it kind of fails the fact that fingerprints are supposed to be an easy and fast way to unlock the device. Face ID is surely taking the smartphone industry by storm, but on any fine day, I'd use my fingerprint to unlock my device rather than the face. But OP6T has made me realize that Face ID is much easy to use and unlock the phone. And the reason is the slow fingerprint scanner. I could actually feel the time it takes to unlock the phone. And no, it doesn't take a second to unlock. On paper it is 0.34s, but I kind of felt the 0.34s being taken by my phone to unlock. It fails a little more than a couple of times a day when it doesn't recognize my finger/thumb, but Im guessing it might get fixed with some future software updates. Moreover, the Face ID comes to the rescue everytime the fingerprint scanner lets me down. The tech is new and interesting and still needs to be worked upon before it is launched in a flagship. The last major change is the loss of 3.5mm headphone jack. Now, this was something which OP could have dodged, but then how would have they given a better and bigger battery. The battery is 3700 mAh, which is bigger which means that even though you get more juice to run your phone, it takes probably longer for the dash charger to charge it. So coming back to the headphone jack, it is not there. Again, it does not really matter, as you get a single type C port, both for charging and plugging in a headset. You get a type C to USB adapter, and to be honest the 3.5mm jack would not create much stir as people are quickly moving towards wireless tech. Unless you have a high spec wired headset, then you may give it a thought.All in all, One Plus delivers with the new 6t. It has some highs and lows, but then its kind of giving you everything for 38K. Not many makers would offer you that. Its my first One Plus device, and I am pretty satisfied with it.

Sometimes apps are stuck on download pending in playstore.2)Camera is good but not that great when compared with other flagships.3)Headphone jack missing.but that's debatable.4)Ram management is not that great.5)Biggest problem i found is everything about the speakers- no stereo speakers, positioning of speakers is bad because it's easily covered while gaming thus forcing you to use headphones.6) Face unlock is great but not that fast like you might have seen in review videos wherein the faceunlock unlocks without showing the lockscreen. That's not the case in reality.it does show lockscreen for almost a second. But that maybe resolved by updates.7) Fingerprint scanner is fast but the screen lights up to100% brightness inorder to scan the finger, which is a little bit annoying.8) Audio via headphones is not impressive for its price.

4.0 out of 5 stars," apologies for the seemingly 'clickbait' title of this review. i'll be as concise as i can.tl;dr: great battery life, a well tuned camera. go for it (this isn't a paid/fake review lol)!CAMERA: has a really high dynamic range. i have been doing street photography since two years now, all based out of a phone camera, as opposed to a dslr or something. although previously i have used budget devices (occasionally a flagship phone belonging to someone else), i have learned a lot. since my genre involves capturing a quick moment, a good/smart hdr process really comes handy. this phone retains details in the HIGHLIGHTS much, much better than a galaxy s9/note 9, iphone x, comparable to pixel 2xl. nope, no exxageration. zoom performance is okay, as it's digital. the secondary lens seems gimmicky, with the company claiming it to help with depth sensing. on covering the second lens, a message does pop up (in the portrait mode). i feel like they can utilize it better with different algorithms. i see wasted potential. the hardware is the same as op6. NIGHT SIGHT from the ported gcam app is INSANE. the stock app is also great at processing photos in LOWLIGHT. if you're like me, if you feel like capturing something in the middle of the night because it looks magical, this camera will not let you down.VIDEO: if you have tried any sort of filmmaking, you'll understand the importance of shooting in 60fps over 30. NOTE- ois is used for 1080/4k 60fps. eis is used for 1080/4k 30fps. eis is amazing during the day, but falls short at night. 4k 60 means you don't get as much light information at night, but it'll have better stabilization. i wish there was some way to manually change that. the final output, once you realize these certain points and use it to your advantage, then it's amazing! TRUST ME.SELFIE: video called to 1080p with eis, has a great dynamic range. but, i feel like the gcam mode performs better while taking selfies, especially selfie portraits.CAMERA final thoughts: if you know what you're doing, GO BUY THIS PHONE.if camera isn't as important to you, then please read on. 4 times out of 5 you'll be happy with what you capture.*just realized i said i'll be concise hahahah* *i'll try again*BATTERY LIFE: the first few days of extreme heavy usage set me back a bit disappointed, as i got a bit more than 6 hours of sot. DON'T MISUNDERSTAND- it's good. definitely. but it didn't quite match up to what i saw online. so get this, i'm not the only one who felt that way.BUT WAIT! after using this phone for 3 weeks (give or take) battery life has improved. i have provided a screenshot for the initial usage, which shows a little over 6 hours. YESTERDAY, i got nearly TEN HOURS.if you're an average user, but still feel like you use the phone heavily because of a few gaming sessions, you won't be disappointed. i don't play games much, but my camera usage is extreme. that explained why i felt disappointed.BATTERY FINAL THOUGHTS? most of you out there can use this phone easily for an entire day. if you're a casual user, then you'll be VERY happy with the battery backup.CHARGING: dash/rapid/warp charge- as fast as ever. 10/10. doesn't throttle the performance. neither does the charging slow down with simultaneous use.SCREEN: I LOVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE DIFFERENT CALIBRATED MODES! oneplus does it right. it's quite accurate. i use dci-p3. for most default is best, as the colors have a lot of saturation, with inky blacks. GOOD brightness, not great though with direct sunlight. BUT WAIT! a paid app (search high brightness mode) enables the actual potential. NOT KIDDING. basically, oneplus has restricted the maximum brightness you can get, to ensure longevity (FOR A GOOD REASON). use that app at your own risk, as toggling it on for long periods of time may be harmful for the phone, as that's not what was intended originally. please don't blame me if you use it without researching further. however, if you are smart about it, you'll be REALLY HAPPY with the results. HONESTLY!DESIGN/BUILD QUALITY: this is something HIGHLY subjective. beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. personally, i'm in love with the minimalism and symmetry. despite the beautiful glossy finish of mirror black, i feel like midnight black/thunder purple showcases how much oneplus cares about ERGONOMICS. i am usually horribly careless with my phones. and this has a glass back, way less durable, seemingly. YET, i feel safe while holding this. they have oaid attention to subtle things, like the amount of curve at the edges of the backside, to make it easier to grip. the matte texture feels so close to a metallic surface, im not lying. if anyone you know has a 6 or a 6t with a matte surface, please do check it out. NOTE: please make sure you have a case on, as glass is glass.i have dropped this phone 4-5 times (which made my heart skip a beat every time). one of the corners has a slight dent (which still makes me feel really sad). however, the materials used are really good. op6 had gorilla glass 5, this has gorilla glass 6. don't be fooled though, glass always has a high chance of breaking. oneplus phones last a long while. they don't have any water/dust resistance certification, but the phone won't be damaged if it comes in contact with water. please don't push it though.FINGERPRINT SCANNER: *evil laugh* if you're still reading, i cannot thank you enough. i hope i was able to help you understand the experience a bit better. okay, i shouldn't stall amy more. the fingerprint scanner isn't as fast, or as secure, or as adept as a regular capacitive scanner (read: oneplus phones before 6t).DON'T MISUNDERSTAND THOUGH. if you don't compare, oneplus makes the experience seem really smooth. yes, the accuracy suffers a bit. BUT, the novelty of this feature, i feel, makes up for it. it makes me smile every time i use it.THAT'S NOT THE ENTIRE STORY THOUGH! oneplus claims it becomes faster with time. at first, in my first week, i felt like this was a smart way of creating a placebo effect. the words felt like a plain marketing talk. BUT, THEY WEREN'T WRONG. i understand the arguments against the scanner, mainly, a) it forces you to look at the screen everytime you want to unlock, in which case the face unlock despite being less secure, would be faster, b) the positioning could be better & c) the feedback doesn't induce confidence if you actually unlocked or not. true, true and true. BUT, as skeptic as i was, i promise you, it has gotten better and faster. how do i attest that? well, earlier success rate was 75%. it did feel like a let down. it seemed half baked. change for the sake of change. NOW, IT'S UP TO 95%. initially it made me feel angry at oneplus, as it felt like 'IS THIS IT FINALLY? has oneplus SETTLED?' *there you go, the headline of my review* jokes aside, the angles that would fail before, wouldn't fail anymore. i do have a guess at how they're achieving this, but i don't feel like boring you any more than i already have. i tried my best to be as honest and unbiased as i could have. let that strengthen your confidence in my verdict about the scanner. trust me. it gets better with time. this is due to artificial intelligence and i'm glad that they didn't loosely throw around the term (*cough* LG/HUAWEI/OPPO *cough*). the way artificial intelligence works, i can ASSURE you that it should get better with time. it has, for me.NOTE: screen protectors do change the experience. oneplus recommends you to re-register the prints. this is definitely a huge annoyance, as it could lead to wastage of money just to figure out what works. i suggest go with reviews, ones which have a more number of reviews, especially 3-4 stars and not 5. if you see a 5 star rating, it probably was the brand itself.i apologize for this long read. if you still are reading, then i think i can assume that you long for this phone. else you wouldn't have read this far. i understand. just, go for it. it's worth it as long as you don't have an op6. wait for 7 if you really want an improved experience. actually, the way they work, and if it means that much to you, wait for op7t. it'll be worth the wait. moreover the op6 will last you well over two years.signing off,alimpan pal (op6t 8+256gb)ps: i dropped out of college to pursue filmmaking. would mean a lot if you visited my instagram page. currently working on my own domain. till then please check out my work, it's all based on phones, you'll definitely find it unique. look up _theunbreakablevow_ (with the underscores).

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The first impression about the phone is that it feels premium in hand. I bought the 6GB, 128 GB, mirror black version.PROS :- Premium feel,- Super fast processing,- Super smooth UI,- Impressive battery life going on 1 and half day on normal usage and one full day on intense usage,- Camera quality is phenomenal,- Sound quality is great,- Face recognition is fastest possible and works in the dark also,CONS :- Has very slippery back, can't be used in daily routine without a back cover,- Water drop notch doesn't feel that good (it is my personal view),- Notification bar is unreachable on single hand use,- Sometimes I struggle to hear the voice on call, I don't know if it is because of the earpiece positioning or I am not used to of having a phone this big,- The ""On screen fingerprint sensor"" is not that fast, it took around 2 seconds to unlock at first but now taking lesser after update. But still, not fast as the physical sensor. Secondly, it doesn't recognise the fingerprint sometimes so that I have to reposition my finger. I barely use it because it has face recognition which is fastest.Overall, it is one of the best phones Available in the market.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought ONEPLUS 6T 6gb ram with 128gb varient.Ultimate feateared mobil devise I ever used till now.Just awesome, met all the technological aspects of future.Now I stopped surfing for latest mobile phones. So why this stands ultimate. Moreover this would be a very big growth in quality mobile which even beats APPLE. Now allover the world started pricing ONEPLUS.Pro:Finger print on displayHuge quantity sound speakersOptimum quality of displayQuality battery of 3700mah ST by 36 hrs with data pack on.Camera = to DSLR with Pro mode and night mode shootRapid fast processorOxygen os makes you breathe easyRapid fast charging  = 0 to 100 % in 45min.Great photos quality with high resolution.Con:3.5mm jack unavailability makes you uncomfortable.Thanks ONEPLUS 🤗

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like the tagline says #NeverSettle stands with this flagship killer. I was an iOS user, after great hesitant I had to move to Android due to Apple's #HighCostNoValue motto.Pros:- Amazing full display- Top notch build quality- Fluidless OxygenOS- Big battery which will go more than a day even after playing games (PUBG) for long time- Fast charging (Love this feature)- Stylish panel- Flawlerss gaming experience, zero lags.- Infinite features compare to AppleCons:- No Stereo speaker. A single speaker will block the sound completely if you are playing a game and you cover the speaker by your hand- No headphone Jack (Works for me as I use bluetooth headset)- Low light photography needs an improvement- In built finger print is not fast than the normal fingerprint scanner.  Face unlock will unlock your phone faster than the fingerprint scanner.  I personally feel this technology was not needed at all.Thats all as of now, will update the list after few months.Conclusion: Go for it if you need a powerfull phone under 40K.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Spent a few days with the phone now and I like it so far. The screen is awesome and the notch is not that bad. The phone feels fast and responsive and oxygen os is pretty good in my opinion. The camera is decent although I would have loved a different secondary lens like a wide angle one. Battery lasts me a full day easily and still has 30% charge remaining by the end. There are a few minor compromises but they dont matter to me personally so I have nothing to complain but i'll still list them out. They say its water resistant but it has no IP certification so I don't know exactly how water resistant it is. No headphone jack but I already used bluetooth headphones even when my phone had a headphone jack so not missing it at all. No wireless charging but I dont use that either so doesn't matter to me. Lastly to me the phone is a looker, I love its looks and seamless design.So at the end for me personally I am getting everything I wanted out of a phone for 20k less than flagship prices so I am happy.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"So, this might be a single case and not a very common issue with everyone, but yeah, here it goes-Picture Quality - the pictures are good, crispy clear, but for some reason it takes an awfully long time to snap a picture, and hence you're never able to capture the right moment, and all this on the default settings, no portrait mode, no other app, default camera app with default settings.Sound Quality - it's okay, it's a phone not a expensive Bluetooth speaker, but yeah, you'll have to buy a Bluetooth earphones/headphones with this phone.Battery Life - does charge pretty fast, but looses all the juice pretty quick, I feel like it's a software issue and I hope it goes away in the next updateOverall UX- not that great, it might be because it's android, or the one plus skin on top, but the UX is just not crisp or enjoyable to navigate.

Good hardware combined with excellent software.6T ticks all the boxes of the modern day flagships, plus it has in-display fingerprint which is surprisingly fast and more convenient than the one mounted on the back.It has improved battery backup, large storage options at relatively same price, excellent memory management and the best UI you will find on a phone.The Oxygen OS gives you the latest offerings from Android and is very responsive and very pleasing just to look at!😍 It gives you a lot of customisation options to make your phone feel more personal.The only small setback is an average camera.

No 3.5 mm jack, you need to use Jack adapter to plugin your headphones, once lost you have to buy a new adapter or you would be bound to purchase Bluetooth headset.6.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Have been using One Plus phones from the 3T days and even though there is a lot of hype with each new version this one does not stand up to the hype. Till date the best One Plus has to be the 5T and except for a few gimmicks (for e.g. the on display finger print scanner) there isn't much that goes for this phone. So why did I buy this one. Very simple, I did not want to miss the UI on the phone as it is the closest you get to a stock Android feel w/o having to bust your bank to buy the Google Pixel and the base variant this time comes with 128 GB storage which was helpful since I had almost used up all the storage (of 64 GB) on my 5T. Also, I got could not resist the buy-back guarantee and feel I invested in this one for a better experience on the next T version.So let's come down to the Pros & Cons.PROS -* The closest you can get to a stock Android UI* Fast charging* DisplayCONS -# Heavy!# Camera hangs up!!# Camera modes s**k and the only useable mode is the normal mode & portrait mode!!!# Nothing significantly different from 5T!!!!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"5 stars for the device. It's the best. But 0 stars for the service I have received. I ordered this phone on 19th December, 2018 and I received it on the very next day. I tried to secure the device against accidental damage, but I came to know that I hadn't received the ""P-slip/warranty"" invoice which is required to claim warranty or insure your device. I have raised multiple complaints since January, 2019 only to be disappointed. I am still in contact with Amazon Executive Customer Relations Team and they are doing a fine work of disappointing me. It's been 4 months of without warranty or protection against accidental damage. If anything happens to my device, I will be at loss. And I'm really regretting now spending so much on this device as I could have gone to black market if I wanted to buy this phone without warranty and saved a lot of money.Update: After 4 months of suffering, they have agreed to replace the product. They have initiated a replacement request and I will get a fresh handset with new invoice. Not so angry anymore!

I can say the fell of phone in hand is not like a premium. Main reason to choose this phone is for speed and battery . My S9 plus was also giving good battery backup, but when I started to use dual sim my battery is draing very quickly and also feeling lag some times. Now I am using OP 6t as my primary device and except feel in hand every thing is like premium. 8gb ram and 128 storage .  Applications are launching Within blink of eye . Even it is faster than iphone x.  I have compared with my freinds phone.Battery backup is good. After using full day 25 % is balance . With screen time of approx 4.5 hrs from 100% to 25. Camera performance is also good. But it can't be compare with iphone x and Samsung's flagship. Only missing thing is  IP certificate for water and dust proof.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have been using it for the past 24 hrs, quite impressed with the smoothness of the OS, also the inhand feel of the device is quite robust. Battery backup is very good, getting around 7 hrs of screen on time. Charging speed is insane, I was able to charge from 10 to 90 in 1 hr. Camera is good during day time, during night time its ok, for better results during night try using gcam port. There are only two downsides imo with 6t,  first lack of 3.5 mm jack, second I felt the screen is slightly less bright. Although I feel these are small issues. Overall it's a grt value for money and at this price the best device

Picture quality and sound quality is very nice battery life is awesome but while ring tone starts some faulty noise comes and hardware  lagging issue is seen some time once in a week. camera quality is not so good, lens could have been more powerful For  Distant sceens . Sound is loud enough for a descent phone. Sound like non branded chinese sets .

But its the Amazon which started to disrespect customers.Initially they did all sorts of support to their customers, but now providing worst service.I prebooked the phone on oct 15th bullet earphones offer, and as per the terms bought it on nov 2 ( despite having plently of launch offers on nov 1 ) i even confirmed with the customer care on having launch offer and pre booking offer. They told me to pick either one. So i decided prebooking headphones.Now after 15 days they are telling am not eligible for prebookinh offers with silly reason.Worst service and very disspointing.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got a good deal with exchange of my previous OnePlus 3.  6T is definitely faster, has a larger screen, better picture quality and larger battery life.  Battery charges to 100% in 40 min. I mostly use the phone for conf. calls, office emails, social media and watching movies. With constant use of all these features, I get a battery life of 20 hours on one charge a day.Night photography is not great even with the addition of new software used to recalibrate the pixels. Day pics are far better and provides very good clarity.Has been using it for 3 days now, so am yet to explore many features in detail. But overall a good phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Early days into using the phone, but have loved every bit of the experience till now. First and foremost it is surprisingly easy to use, I mean it adjust very easily into the grip even after it's relatively big size. The curved back makes it easy to use and manoeuvre . The camera is pretty good and does well in all of it's mode but yes still some distance away from the quality of Pixel cameras. The battery life is great and last for almost 24-30 hours per charge. The oxygen OS is almost stock like and gives a very uncluttered experience. The performance of the phone has been top notch - switching between apps is smooth, performance during games, watching youtube videos etc has been fluent and top notch. The in-display fingerprint works almost perfectly. It's fast but at times is unable to recognize. That is probably the only complaint with the device. Good Job One Plus. :)

5.0 out of 5 stars,"coming from the Samsung Note series, One plus felt like a complete refresh and a makeover. The software experience kept me hooked on all the time and got me addicted pretty quick. Even though the prices keep increasing I still feel its comparatively less expensive than the other flagships.I got google camera installed and the results were just eye-opening, the one plus camera is still pretty good though.The battery lasted me through the day with moderate to heavy usage so no issues there.The display although not as good as the Samsung's, I felt it came pretty close.I just feel the audio experience through the phone could've been better, hope an update improves things.To put it simply, It a fabulous phone and a definite and comparatively affordable buy!

Good job there. Fingerprint scans super fast. Love the glossy mirror black back, came with a protective case in the box.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"The software has minor glitches as such the mobile do not respond per command sometimes and is now more frequent. The software has some problem as the screen text becomes big suddenly. One Plus must look into it as the reputation of One Plus 6T may go down if others also face similar problem.I still think One Plus 3 was performing extremely well than One Plus 6T.  I sometimes get a feeling that has One Plus secretly named 'T' as Temporary or Beta Version before the launch of next version say in this case after 6T Launch of 7. Its just a wild guess as had faced Zero issues with One Plus 03 for almost two years since purchase. 6T was purchased brand new from Amazon but its software does not perform well

Camera as of now is working good... Speed of the mobile is also good, but is almost same and not that fast of what they are claiming to be... Also, I strongly feel the box and contents in box are unnecessary, like seperate orange outter cover of box, album of hard board, momento, etc. are just to make it more expensive and to pull more money out of our pockets...

The battery life is excellent for a flagship phone, about 8 hours of SOT which is more than excellent, also the speaker, though single is loud enough for the noisiest of environments.

But the camera is not consistent, with the pictures it takes, some times they are great and some times i regret spending this much ona phone.If you want better camera i suggest you go for last year's pixel or a lg phone. Or Infact a 15k phone with gcam can also give you better and consistent photos.Also if you are buying this for the snapdragon i suggest you go for poco phone.With these prices this phone is no more a flagship killer. And now with so many better phones out  we don't have a better explanation as to why we need oneplus, because it charges us 40k and does not give us io rating nor a better screen and not event better photos so its better to go for last year's flagships from samsung or lg or to get a midranger from Nokia of poco.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Moving to OnePlus 6t from a budget phone, first of all I noticed a lot of difference in the performance, camera quality, battery life, charging speed, build quality, etc.It has got a fabulous dual camera at the back which takes really good pictures, the primary camera being 16 megapixels and the secondary 20 megapixels.Although the native camera app is good on the phone I recommend using the google pixel camera app as it has the best software processing and it takes better picture overall. The front camera of the phone is also really good which is of 16 megapixels. The phone supports slow motion videos at two levels i.e, 240 fps at 1080p resolution and 480 fps at 720p resolution.Saying about the build quality, it is really good. I had a time of bad luck when I met with a bus accident as the bus(sleeper) toppled and I kept my phone on the seat, the phone was thrown around inside the bus and to my luck nothing happens to my phone although I had an official OnePlus 6t phone case on it.Battery life is really good on this device. It will easily last for a day on heavy usage or even a day and a half with moderate usage. Charging speed is really good. Before I go to college I charge it during the time I get ready and that is enough for the phone till evening.Coming to software oxygen os is really good and snappy although there is some features missing from the stock android operating system although they have better features added to itSaying about heating of the device, I should say it never literally overheats, the only time I found it overheat was when I was using CamScanner for a bit long. Gaming was completely fine as it never overheats during gaming although it gets slightly warm near the camera region which is least bothersome.

The inbuilt fingerprint sensor sometimes doesn't work quickly, I have to place my thumb 1-2 times in different position to get it work.2. Again the fingerprint sensor at night time when all lights are off and when you unlock ur phone with fingerprint sensor the screen brighten ups to it's fullest (like it's stealing my eyesight  😜)3. The night scape mode in camera it processes too long which is embarrassing when I'm showing off this features to friends4. The most important thing this is not actually an issue, but just a suggestion - I really miss the notification LED light, because every time I've to pick up the phone to check wether I have a notification or not or for what my phone had buzzed.There's a app called as NO LED available on play store which uses some pixels to color up and  show up in the lock screen but it's annoying I'm sure OnePlus can definitely come with a better app or solution.I'm sure this issues can easily resolved by the company in a software update.Thanks for reading.Overall it's the best phone for this budget range go for it and buy it.Update : finger print issue is resolved it's now quick

Thanks Amazon so much..❤️Loved The new tear drop Notch❤️ Speed is great❤️ Battery works for hours.. Screen on time is around 7 hours❤️Alert slider is good too❤️Camera Quality is So Clear n perfect.. I don't need a DSLR no more..❤️ It's big because of it's huge battery so keeps on sliding off my hands but You're getting a cover in box so no worries😍😍 and lacks Audio Jack which is a drawback but Now It's common in all phones so can't complain😂❤️Wish they provided it with C type earphones but it was not in box🤩Overall It's a great Deal Go for it..

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Its almost 2 weeks since I am using this phone (8GB RAM + 128 GB ROM) Battery life is good ~3700 mAH but I am really disappointed with the slowness of its finger print sensor. In spite of having 8GB RAM, application's performance reduced after 4GB of RAM exhaustion. It seems that just putting more GB in RAM couldn't make mobile faster. One plus should also work on inter-module compatibility of mobile that means RAM should be efficiently in-sync with processors and its performance.In nut shell its a good phone but heavy app users who wants 100% performance shouldn't expect much.

Already using for 2 weeks and never had it drop below 40 % as i charge it. It charges so fast.

There are new flagship killers in the sub 30 thousand segment that can challenge and even give the OnePlus 6t a run for the money. Smart phones only last three to four years and OnePlus will launch a new model almost every year. This should last at least three years with moderate use.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First thing first there is nothing wrong with one plus 6t.The screen is amoled which has good viewing angles.Colours are vibrant and screen brightness is also good.Camera is great but could have been better. Sound quality is good but lack of dual speakers still hurts.Battery backup is improved courtesy the 3700 mAh battery. Snapdragon 845 with oxygen os is an experience of its kind.Though I have used one plus since their flagship killer one plus one, a customer centric and community driven company is losing its own tagline of Never Settle by trying to settle down with no headphone jack,a camera hardware which remains same since one plus 5,no IP certification,no wireless charging.Above all the all the inflating costs of OnePlus phones when a smartphone with the same processor is being sold at half the price. I hope to see better innovative and original ideas from the OnePlus team in future as still I believe they can do it!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm reviewing after about a week of usage. I donno about the previous OnePlus models, I just entered the OnePlus community with the 8 GB +128 GB VersionAs far as the mobile goes it's a beast, I'm totally satisfied with the performance of the productPros1. Awesome Processor - Snapdragon 845 at its best, combined with the 8 GB RAM, you experience 0 lag on a perfect WiFi connection2. Good Daylight Camera, 4K video with 60 fps frame rate felt dang awesome3. Big Cheers for the near complete Display, OPTIC AMOLED gives a great viewing experience4. Speakers are loud but having Stereo speakers would have done great to this mobile5. DASH Charge works great! Speed is what you need6. The USB-C to 3.5 mm Headphone jack cable is sturdy, I was worried that the earphones piece may fall off but nodes within the jack space save the drop and hold it in place7. Good Delivery and the Packaging, fell in love with OnePlus8. InDisplay Fingerprint scanner is awesome. It takes less than half a second to do the job9. Face unlock is super fast10. Near Stock Android UI is great..! Oxygen OS simply does a terrific job11. Teardrop notch is awesome, although I covered the notch area for my notification bar and the blacked out notification bar is great12. Adding a USB C Hub expands it's functionality, combining with the 6.4 inch screen almost gives a PC like experienceCons1. Battery life doesn't seem that great although I'm a kinda heavy user2. Night camera is bad, My RX 100 mk2 does a great job when compared to this3. Camera zoom is terrible, I hate that part of the Smartphone camera. Again My RX 100 mk 2 does a great job4. Implementation of the fingerprint on the power button would have been good, take a note OnePlus5. Adding a display that supports 4K would have been a great thing, of miss 4K videos on YouTube6. Next time release Gaming phones with add-ons like 120 fps display, 4k display and a gaming chipOverall it's a beastI gave my honest opinion

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Heard lots of great things about the Oneplus and decided to purchase it. Overall it's a great sturdy phone. The interface tends to hang here and their when used. The battery life is just about a day which is disappointing.I switched from an Iphone and lets just say im still missing it.The Amazon music app is super basic and they need to update the music and it's playlist.While the camera is great in most areas, the portrait mode is complicated and takes lots of time to adjust. While using Instagram camera to click a video or story the quality or picture and sound it poor.It has numerous pop up ads on any thin you use. So be aware of it. With the latest software update there are issues while using apps like Unfold where the keypad doesnt close for you to be able to use it's options to edit. This is quite a silly glitch.Great phone for android user but for Apple's users stick to apple.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used samsung s9 before having this mobile. After using this i am surprised with the differences. Oneplus 6T is far far far better in every field except in looks becausse of S9 curved display.Battery - 7 hrs SOT with 24 hrs idle time.Camera - Best in class. i observed S9 captured bit better in low light, because of f1.6 aperture, oneplus 6t is not far behind. Thanks to night mode.bokeh/portrait mode is exceptionnaly better than s9 and same with Day light.Display - S9 has better display but u cant use that otherwise your battery wont even last for 3 hours. Oneplus 6T has Amoled display which is enough for me.Indisplay Fingerprint - Using first time in any mobile, i liked it . response time is few micro seconds more than traditional finger print scanner. only few ms.Face Recognition - Great, even in full dark. most of the time u wont even see the lock screen as soon as u press the lock button it opens. In full dark, it uses screen light to recognize the face.Processer and performance - Best in class. i used to play pubg in high settings without any heating issue. All games runs very smooth. i tried GTA, asphalt, need for speed NL, etc.Gesture support is great after update. Its very fast and user friendly.Sound - Single speaker, Speaker sound is OK, not so great. S9 has better speaker sound than this.

Camera captures the sharp images very efficiently even in the low lighting and hours of gaming doesn't heat it at all and that battery keeps you going all day long with the usage of internet and heavy gaming.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had always been opposed to One Plus products, mainly because they were of Chinese origin, and I had a fixed notion that Chinese products were prone to cut corners, and therefore not always up to the mark. I have been using iPhones for the past several years, and was quite happy with them. It was only recently when iPhone came out with their flagship phone range 10 that I realized that they had, in their greed, priced themselves out of my affordability range. I mean, who wants to pay one lakh rupees of one's hard-earned money for a phone?So, since I had already purchased FOUR One Plus phones for people who were not net-savvy, and had received good feedback from them, I decided to buy one for myself. I was absolutely bowled over with the phone once I started using it because it had everything that my last iPhone had, plus a lot more. The speed was far, far superior, as were the cameras (and quality of the photographs) and the battery life - I can easily go for two days without recharging my phone battery.To summarize, I would recommend this phone to anyone without reservations - you will get more than fair value for your money.

Let's talk about how I feel about using OnePlus 6T for 2 months.What I loved about it :1. Amazing and probably fastest face unlock ever.2. Amazing performance in terms of gaming and excessive usage of apps.3. I'm very satisfied with camera, it's not the best out there but it's pretty good.4. In built sensors are upto the mark and works perfectly.5. Dash charging, imagine playing pubg with your friends and suddenly after a few match you notice your battery's at 12%. You tell your friends to take a break, drink water or eat something and by the time they are done with that... You have successfully charged your phone to 33% in just 7 mins. Now you can play 4 more games. Although please don't.6. This is not a OnePlus 6T pro directly but OnePlus wireless earphones work really great with OnePlus 6T phone and I'm just in love with it. Now I never have to worry about charging and playing at the same time.What I didn't like about it :1. In display finger print could have been better, it takes a lot more time than I thought it would take. It works really well at times but sometimes it doesn't.2. It's probably just with my phone and not that common bug, I do sometime get stuck on lockscreen and pressing power button doesn't do anything for a second or two.

Finger print takes little more time compared to physical sensors. It tells that physical sensors is very fast in finger print enrollment and verification. My suggestion would be if the on screen sensor works normally it will be great to use. Now using face detection to unlock the device.

Simple Words i will never again shop on Amazon ever in my life for any electronic products. Although, the service centre has asked me to bring the phone for checking the firmware. i am disappointed with Amazon sales, as i never expected this month phone to go become unusable within 30 days of purchasing. Shame on you Amazon.. Stop cheating customers....

Still the battery holds good.2). Sound quality is good.3) Default back case that comes with box is good.4) Camera quality is good not that great!Cons:1) In-Display finger print scanner stops working randomly, I have to lock and unlock the phone again to make it works.2) The amount of time taken to unlock the phone via Fingerprint scanner lags sometimes but it works well most of the time.3) Night sight mode needs to be improved. The images taken with low lighting is not that great. Looks Ok Ok.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first true smartphone was a preimum one back in 2011 and 4 yrs later I upgraded to another one from the same premium brand in 2015.. After a recent OS upgrade my died and started rebooting endlessly. It was time for an upgrade. I like the premium phones I used and hated Android for not being fast and smooth. But this premium brand has just overpriced their lineup by crossing 1L pricing mark there's no point in spending that much for just a phone. After a lot of reviews and considerations I've opted for OnePlus 6T and it was under my 40k budget.WHAT A PRODUCT!! Brilliant phone with all bells and whistles that you get on a premium brand and it is surprising to have come from a company which is just a few years old. I'm very happy with this phone and with OnePlus brand itself. I'm not going away from this brand anytime soon and will be upgrading on this platform for many years to come.. Bye bye fruit!!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second OP after OP5. Amazing phone. Here are some pros and cons-Pros-1) Water Drop Notch2) Screen Unlock3) Bigger Battery4) Amazing Camera on both sidesCons-1) If you wanna unlock your phone via either Screen Lock or Face Unlock, you have to make screen on,which is annoying sometimes. In this way I like my OP5 because there is FPS and I can unlock my phone just by pressing it. I am sure One Plus will look into this.2) Nightscape- Although I am very used to Oxygen OS but I cannot fully satisfied with Nightscape mode of camera. It always gives blurry pics but happy with overall performance.3) No LED Notification- Due to waterdrop notch they sacrifies Notification light, which is very disappointed from my perspective. well I think that if there is no hardware for LED notification then OP team should come with a software update by which a small pixel work just like a notification led.So here are some pros and cons. Considering these cons I still give 5/5. It's just amazing phone. And if you compere with any other smartphone for eg Pixel 3,then it is far way ahead of those.A must buy for premium phone lovers, I can bet you'll not get disappoint by this.

The phone take time to get used to, especially with the cover. the cover is thick enough to take away the sexy glass black look.

Though it is 3700mah battery, it beats 4000 mah phones easily.Face unlock is very fast and unlocks even in lower light conditions even though IR recognition is not there.On display fingerprint looks very cool and is fast as well.The quality of audio is not at all compromised with the type-c to 3.5mm converter. No need to worry about the lost headphone jack. Speakers are loud and very good.Camera is very great in all sections and nightscape takes astonishing shots in low light conditions.No need to speak of AMOLED display which will be wonderful.Finally I did not find any issues with this phone till now and will make you know if I find any.

Ordered at 9pm and got delivered next morning 7am. from being a user of one plus X this an amazing upgrade and experience for me. Here i'll list my pros and cons with reviewPros:- Camera : Both front and back camera done amazing job. Its night mode feature is killer and quality is so good.- Battery : I could use phone for more then 2 day with normal usage when charged full.- Dash charging - oh, this amazing really fast.- Notch - Really impressive, one don't even realise if its there.- Memory : Ample of space, got 113 GB of space, which is actually more then my mac book pro :D- Ram : 6 GB ram is more than enough for me as i normally don't play heavy games nor keep many activity window open.- Processor :  Good, can give better review after usage for more than 2-3 months. as of now no lag.- Face unlock - This is killer, you won't even realise when the unlock happened, very fast.- Screen quality - Dense pixel make screen very good with large view. Good auto brightness and colours.- In display finger print scanner - This looks fancy, very rarely i had to use it because of good face unlock. Although i felt its bit slow compare to normal finger scanner.Cons:- No 3.5 mm jack. Although you have connector its not very convenient. Alternatively i had to invest in bluetooth headphone.- Screen size, For not many of you it will be a cons, but for me i feel size is little bigger to carry in hand. personal choice, Anyways it gives bigger view when use full screen camera.- No notification led, I felt they did not kept it because of smaller notch but i really miss that as every time i have to actually check the phone if someone has messaged or call me as my phone is mostly on silent mode.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's been 2 weeks I am using this phone and I must say I am pretty impressed with its -1. Performance - Thanks to its snapdragon Octa core 845 processor. I can play PUBG without any issue. Also 6 GB is so far seems more than enough for me.2. Battery Life - Battery life is a very important factor for a heavy user like me. With a heavy usage it goes for a day. If I use moderately it goes upto 45 hours. Though the battery optimization is the part of Android 9.0 but thanks to Oxygen OS, unlike Samsung it doesn't drain battery when idle.3. Fingerprint Under Display - it's been said ""in screen fingerprint"". But the correct term should be ""under display fingerprint"". Anyway its not as fast as regular fingerprint reader but its good for every day use and most importantly - it's super cool 😎4. Built Quality - comparable to premium flagships like Samsung Galaxy Note 9 or iPhone XS5. Oxygen OS - Oxygen OS may not be pure stock Android but I believe this is how Android pie should have been. I believe Oxygen OS completes Android.6. Global LTE bands - Since it has almost all global LTE Bands so this phone is highly recommend for International travellers.7. Camera - As I am a DSLR guy so I am always biased against phone cameras. But I must say tgis phones picture quality is 7/10. Would have given 8 if nightmode would have been better. May be OnePlus will fix it with a patch upgrade.Great Job OnePlus. My best regards -

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Its a product with really good performance. has been 3 days since I bought it , have also ordered a back cover as the one available with the phone is a bit smooth, which might slip from your hands or pop out of jacket pockets during my morning jogging . Gestures are really good . finger print sensor isnt absolutely perfect but to be realistic works pretty well . Face recognision is the other best alternative which works rapid fast unless its totally dark. Battery back up is descent till now, full charge in almost an hour. with all videos games and downloads it might drain out by the end of the day. which means daily 1 hr charge, hopefully the batter performace last for couple of years. Download backdrops for alternate wall papers experience. 8 GB RAM and 128 GB storage gives you realistically good performace while downloads or streaming.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"You might find cheaper phones with similar specifications but you won't find the quality build and level of performance provided by 6T within the price range. The phone lives up to the hype. Its a true geeks companion. The huge number of settings available might overwhelm someone who is only using phones to click selfies and tiktok videos. Picture quality is undeniably good. Sound quality is amazing. Battery life extends upto 24 hours. Dash charging FTW. Power management is great. Stock OS is the best. No longer there's a NEED to flash some custom ROM unless you WANT to. In the end it all boils down to how you treat your phone. Be it any phone. Treat the device well. And let the device show you what true performance is. Money well spent.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is one of the astonishing things that I ordered. The phone is just amazing and flawless and the camera steals the show.I really like on screen finger print scanner and it works perfectly fine if you do it properly. Yes, it will takes time to settle but then It is One plus 6t.The packing was good but there were no air bags to stop the box from moving inside a larger box. Other than that everything is just amazing.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Its integration with other devices is highly irritating. Have faced multiple consistent  issues in last 2 weeks which are very usage specific.1. Android Auto Issues: App crashes multiple times on launch. After multiple times when it is launched the still gives you money issues like a) cannot hear incoming call volume everything goes mute ,when music suddenly stops you need to look at your phone to see the incoming call, before oneplus 6t the notification itself used to come on screen and the incoming call volume used to come out from car speakers. b) USB cable keeps on disconnecting randomly you have to connect it again and again multiple times for it to work. c) it stops recognising voice commands randomly.Although the voice command to control navigation works perfectly fine.2.Bluetooth connectivity with MIband3: most of the time the bluetooth connection gets disconnected automatically. when you try to connect it manually it does not work you have to forget the device and then pair it as the new device.3.Google contacts: i use google contacts to maintain my contacts. During the transfer to this phone my random contacts went missing. Okay I made peace with it. Then randomly some contacts were erased from my google account which were there after migration. I restored the contacts to 20 days back. But again the contacts started disappearing. Still unable to figure it out. Also my offline playlist on google play music was deleted.4. Camera Issue: In normal mode Upper half of my photos are mostly blurred especially the ones containing text. I have set everything to default again and tried multiple things but nothing works.Some of the issues maybe related to Android or Google but I have never faced such issues before with my other devices.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounk is ok not impressive, has too much treble compared to bass. Sometimes the physical buttons do not work(happened twice in 1 month) and needs to be restarted. To restart you have to set scheduled time off in the settings as the physical button does not work. Finger print scanner is very bad compared to my Moto Zplay, i have started to use keyboard password. Face scanner does not work properly when light is low. Not value for money, may be good to try other options. After 1 month of use, battery is good and gets charged within 40 min. Camera is good even in low light with night mode.If you want to connect to Android auto in your car, you have to use the cable provided by the supplier, other cables are not supported. If you want to buy additional cable from 1+ showroom it costs Rs1200 and additional 1200 for the dash charger.

Simply Fantastic !!!Had gone through several reviews for this phone on different forums. So I knew what to expect and has not disappointed yet.Experience opening the box and getting the phone started and configured was easy and seamless.As for accessories you get all that is mentioned in the box. No earphones ...What has stuck me so far:Speed: It is lightening fast ... UI experience seems like a breeze.In display finger print sensor is very cool ... takes some few minutes to set it up till it gets the finger print and edges detected ... but after that the sensor works really good.Battery life: For an average user (making few phone calls, accesses social media (whatsapp, facebook, youtube, etc.), little gaming, and a bit of camera usage, the battery life is on higher side ... I did not have to charge the phone for a couple of days.Display: Is very good and lively.Size of the phone ... Can feel a little big especially for people with smaller hands.Camera: It's way better than what I am used to. But I think it would depend on what phone you had earlier from an experience perspective. I need to explore it more.It has been 4 days since we got the phone so far it has been worth the purchase ... happy.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using OnePlus3 since 2.5 years without any issue, thanks to  OnePlus's awesome updates and software optimization which is probably the best among any Android phones available in the market.Had no doubt that OnePlus6T will be smoother and better.First impression,1. Long lasting battery (20-30% more than OP3)2. Buttery smooth Oxygen OS (much more refined)3. Awesome back camera quality both for pictures as well as videos4. Front camera is biggest improvement over OP35. In screen fingerprint sensor is just a little slower than normal fingerprint sensor on OP3.6. Missing headphone jack, only thing which disappointed me till now. USB C to 3.5mm cable is included in the box.7. Back cover provided inside box is best fit, no need to buy any cover separately also screengaurd is pre applied.8. Guaranteed exchange program is promising must go for that.Bought this with exchange and with HDFC card offer making effective price of 32650/-. Thanks to Amazon for that.OnePlus is by far the best optimised Android phones in the market with minimal, stock like customizations.Go for it if you haven't used OnePlus ever before you will definitely love this device and if you are already using OnePlus device then you would know the user experience is the best when it comes to Oxygen OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars," Pros:-Great performance.-Top notch display.-Fingerprint reader is actually pretty fast ifyou set it up properly-Awesome battery life, I get around 10hours screen on time and you can get aday's charge in 30 mins of charging.-Oxygen os is the best software experienceyou can get on an Android phone hands down, and the navigation gestures are fluid and fun to use.-Cameras are just amazing , you can't tell any difference when you compare it with the pics taken in a pixel or a Samsung Galaxy. And it's it wayyy better than iphone cameras c:You can shoot videos upto 4k 60fps and it is very smooth and sharp.Front facing camera works well too ( get Google cam Port for the best portrait selfies, you're welcome)-Build quality is very good, best looking and feeling Android phone under 40k.Cons:- No headphone jack. RIP jack.but as long as you get the usb c bullets, you won't miss it at all, and you don't have to worry about using ur earphones while charging because you will hardly spend time charging this phone. Charge it when you wake up and get ready for the day and have a cup of coffee and it will be charged-No wireless charging, but hey dash charge 🤷🏻‍♂️-No major upgrades from the OnePlus 6, if you own a OP6, don't get this phone.  Wait for a 7 or 7t-No ip rating, but can survive a few dunks in the waterSo if you're okay with USB c audio and want a great looking phone which turns heads, but also perfoms like a Beast, you should absolutely get this phone, best Android phone you can get right now!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"OnePlus is on right track to kill the Flagship Phones, and the legacy continues with 6T also.

Comfortable to hold in hand.-Face recognition works like magic, even in night with no light source aroundCons--Portrait mode in camera produce photos with less recognizable blurring between subject and behind scene, sometimes missing focus on subject also.-I found battery backup to be on a little side compared to OP 6 inspite of larger battery housing.-Indisplay fingerprint scanner looks amazing but it takes a little time to unlock phone, however it is operable and becomes fast with every use.Thanks.

The speed is very fast with 8 GB RAM.  Battery lasts for more than a day with moderate use including video calls, emails etc. Almost pure android experience, with no clutter or bloated software. UI experience is excellent. Pre installed apps are useful. Very satisfied & happy with nearly 10 days of use. Charging is very fast due to dash charger.

Performance is only next to iPhone xs max and mate 20 pro, however these devices are much costlier than 6tDisplay:It's fricking good , one of the best full HD display in this rangeIn display finger print scanner:Guys, this is so so good, it's very fast, not lagging as mentioned in other reviewsBattery:Again a department where OnePlus 6t takes a big leap. I have been using poco F1 with 4000 mih battery, but 6t with 3700 mih lasts longer than poco F1.Camera:Camera is better than poco F1, however the night mode of 6t cannot be compared with pixel 3( you can take a shot in pitch dark), this is where OnePlus has to improve if it wants to become real flagship rather than being `flagship killer`.  However I am happy with camera performance considering the price point.Cons:None - it would be unfair to mention anything in cons as I don't find any.Final verdict: OnePlus has put in their heart and soul in making 6t .

The Google Play Store app update or download takes hours while it takes just seconds on my other phone, Mi Max 2. I use Airtel 4G SIMs on both phones. One Plus 6T has another Jio SIM. As far as other internet activities like browsing are concerned, I have not noticed any difference from my experience with my earlier phone, Samsung Galaxy A9 Pro. Then comes the shocker this morning. I called One Plus India helpline 1800 102 8411. I was asked to choose my language: press 1 for English and 2 for Hindi. I pressed 1 for English. I was told that was an invalid option 🤔.  Pressed 2. That was also an invalid option. 🤨 When I repeated it for the third time, I was hung up on. I called up again. The same thing kept happening!!!

The first few times, restarting the phone helped but now, even restarting doesn't do anything!The picture quality is nice, if you are not paying attention. Like most Chinese phones, you will notice that the pictures are all 'touched' and its like using those filters which make you look younger/fairer/prettier, not the actual pictures with clarity.The text suggestions don't work the same way, faced issues with 'Strava' app and noticed online that other did too...the list is long.All in all, I am already frustrated with this phone in 2 months and don't know how long this relationship will last!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's been 3 months now that I am using this phone.I would say it's an average phone as per the money it ask for. Battery wise, it's an amazing device with a better performance (multitasking is smooth).But has a defect in taking perfect pictures. It's so reddish and finger scanning is nothing but an additional graphic tool to attract customers.Need One Plus to bring updates on improvements.

In display fingerprint very fast, but sometimes it's not working or take time to unlock phone,  .. Gaming experience superb, but sometimes it becomes very hot while playing pubg , after 2 months of use I never faceed any problems. Oxygen OS is superb.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was also purchased one plus 6 but 6t is not as satisfactory as expected..... Think manufacturers have in a hurry or over confident to launch 6t. May add more features and also think about battery.Specifically finger unlocking system is poor than one plus6 . removeal head phone jack is meaningless...Concluding remark is ""meaningless launch of 6t""One plus 6 is enough for at least next one and half year.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Being a proud user of OnePlus2 for over 3 years, my expectations were already on a higher side when buying the new OnePlus 6T phone....and it definitely lived up to those expectations without any doubt!!! 1 month now since I started using and haven't face any noticeable issue as yet.....Excellent picture quality with dual camera at rear as well as front camera...Sound quality from speakers could have been better but still not bad......But what impressed me most is the battery life and the dash charging capability....just 1-1.5 hrs to fully charge the phone and it lasts for almost 2 days without charging....also like the new Gaming Mode feature which stops notification popping up while playing games !!!

4.0 out of 5 stars,"If at all there is a flaw in the phone.. I guess it's the default launch and there icons of the app. Few are round, few are square. Hope one plus will fix this soon.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything is good but the camera's picture quality is worst....it's disappointing factor for me even my iPhone 6 clicks good photos some times to compare OP6T. Sometimes auto focus is not working as well as picture quality is not good if you clicked 4-5 pics, 2-3 pics are out of focus and in night photography there are too much noise.And second problem is some times in display fingerprint not works well....taking too much time to recognize.-Battery backup is good (It's enough for whole 1 day if you charged once in the morning....Full charging gets approx 1.5 hr time)-Sound quality is average. Noisy speaker feels like a cheap. Some times I missed 3.5 jack.-Premium looks and display quality are awesome.-Speed and performance are fantastic.-And last It's Feels heavy.-Otherwise all things good.I got 3k discount on this phone when ordered on 1st nov (2k in ICICI bank debit card + 1k cashback on amazon pay) & also got 2K discount because of RS. 1500 earphone + 500 cashback early booking offer. So, overall I paid 33k for 6gb ram +128gb storage on 6T.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Extremely powerful, as i switched from ios to this phone. The battery lasts for a whole day under heavy usage, and speaking about the charging the dash charging does a fantastic job charging roughly upto 60 to 70 percent in just 20 mins. The videos and gaming on this phone is a treat for all the gamers and the video lovers. The face recognition works damn smooth. The only con about the one plus 6t that i would like to mention is, the in display finger print sensor which works well but a times fails to unlock if the finger is not perfectly placed, but this issue being a very minor one, the pros very well surpasses the only con. Talking about the camera, it has one of the very best lens under this price category as compared to other handsets. The portrait and the night mode is commendable along with the selfie cam. The google cam app although makes the camera more enhanced. Also the updates provied by the oneplus team too gets a thumbsup.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've upgraded from OnePlus 3 to OnePlus 6t and it's an huge upgrade for me firstly I will start with design which is perfect it's jus feels really good the OnePlus has designed this phone and it's crazy fast everything on the phone is so smooth and responsive thanks to oxygen os and display is gorgeous I cant stop looking at it again and again , performance is class leading due to snapdragon 845 and software optimization and battery backup is great on this phone for normal users it will give two days backup with around 4 hours of screen usage and normal calling and for heavy using it will easily last a day , there's only one thing I'm bit disappointed is charging which is little slower than OnePlus 3 which takes around 1:15 to charge and OnePlus 6t takes around 1:35 to charge i don't know why even though it's fastest among the competition 😎 , so the bottom line is if you want spend 40-60k on a phone don't think about any other phone just go for it

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just bought OP6T on Nov 1st. So far great experience. Just one word AMAZING...The finger print scanner looks great and I kind of like the fancy feel that it provides. The phone operates smooth and the battery back up is bang on!!! With high end usage it lasted 1-1.5 day approx. With minimal usage I could get 2 days out of it. I love the reading mode (kindle app), however not like kindle though..;-).Cons: 3.5 mm audio jack absence is something that you might feel for a while.On the flip side, this trend of removing audio jack is quite catching up if you see in all the recent launches. So, probably this is something futuristic. Overall, great features. Being my first experience with one plus, I must say I loved the experience so far. Will be back with detailed review in the near future...

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Waited 2 months for this beauty cum beast to launch and here I'm reviewing the same from the beast itself. Along with the OnePlus 6t, I had kept Poco F1 and Asus ZenFone 5Z as my other options but finally decided to go with the OnePlus 6t. Let's go through it's features point wise...1- AvailabilityAs a customer, waiting for something u want to buy badly is the worst thing. I made up my mind to buy this device after watching almost all the reviews on YouTube of OnePlus 6 , Poco F1 and Asus ZenFone 5Z but black colour was not my first choice. It was only available in black variant at the time of launch with no information about any other variant. This is why I could not avail offers during Diwali time. I had to wait 15 more days for the ""Thunder Purple"" variant to launch but that too was launched in flash sale fashion which is something not expected from OnePlus. Though later they made the thunder purple variant available all the time.Due to this marketing style, OnePlus ends up forcing some customers to choose the variant which may not be their first choice and as a customer u feel dissatisfied.2-First Look and Build QualityIt was like love at first sight. I could not get my eyes off this beauty. The purple colour merging with the black colour on the top looks mesmerising. Build quality, as heard in several reviews, is top notch. And talking of notch, the water drop notch adds up to the beauty to look even more stunning. Full marks in this section.3- PerformanceHeard it, Seen it, Used it and Felt it. Undoubtedly it's the beast when it comes to performance. You'll feel the smoothness as u use the device. I have used my friend's Poco and Asus ZenFone 5z too...but the experience is smoother in this device for sure. Full marks and OnePlus for the awesome Oxygen OS in performance section4- Sound QualityDecent enough but lacks the experience of a stereo speakers. What to do...Dil Maangey More h(Never Satisfied)5- Battery LifeEarlier I was using a mobile with 4200mah battery which was giving more than a day backup easily. I was ready for a decrease in the backup with OnePlus 6t as compared to my earlier device but the experience was just shocking. OnePlus 6t was giving the same backup as a 4200mah phone. Adding to this amazing battery life is the dash charger which charges the phone with such a great speed that you'll doubt who is in more hurry...You or your charger!!!6-Picture QualityIn normal lighting conditions it undoubtedly takes awesome pictures. Saturation level is just perfect...Colours captured are always close to the original apart from some rare moments when I felt that pics were on warmer side but that's just me!!!Night mode pictures are better than Poco and Asus ZenFone 5z but surely you don't want it to be compared with Google pixel's night mode!!!7- GamingI have 8gb variant and I must say that my gaming experience till now is amazing. With the specs and software provided in this device, u don't need to even think about your gaming experience... it's bound to be buttery smooth!!!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Build Quality : 10/10Camera: 8/10 (Though, I believe this will change with software updates in the future)Sound/9/10Performance: 10/10Should You buy this over Poco f1?Ans: Yes, If you want better service guarantee and a well-built phone + Under Display FP Scanner.CAMERA:The camera is pretty decent for the price. The hardware setup which they are using is top tier but the only place where the camera falls short is the poor algorithm for Night Mode. Rest assured, XDA devs will probably push a Gcam later this month which will most probably pull the camera department upto a Solid 9 if not 10. Will update once that happens !BATTERY: This phone has the best battery backup I've seen in the industry. I am getting around 7.5/8 hours of SOT and the phone only takes about 45-50 minutes to fully charge. This was mindblowing for me.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I think it's a great product. It's got the speed that you'll always find handy--whether you're gaming or idling on social media or doing anything that's resource-intensive. Seriously. And this fast performance goes to the next level with OxygenOS--I sometimes feel that it's even better than stock Android.But the in-screen fingerprint sensor isn't as reliable as its physical counterpart. But, yeah, this new tech is evolving, so it's better to give it some time to show its full worth. And if you're placing the finger the way you should on that in-display sensor, then its performance is right on the money.Plus, the absence of the headphone jack is discomforting, but that was a necessary trade-off if you want to enjoy that futuristic in-screen fingerprint tech.Now that we've dealt with the performance part, let's see how this device performs in the LOOKS department.As far as this device's looks go, it's gorgeous. You know, glass and metal really make a product's aesthetics score go off the charts.Overall, if you're willing to spend around 38 grand on a device that performs like a beast and if you don't mind that not-always-dependable fingerprint sensor or the exclusion of Mr. Jack, this device is for you!P.S. I haven't covered sound or camera because I don't have much knowledge about that. Yeah, screen quality is good--after all, it's AMOLED.

I couldn't unlock my phone with the power button. I managed to unlock through double tap. Later its volume buttons also stop functioning. No longer  I could adjust its volume. I contacted the Amazon service. They checked the phone through an application and confirmed the issues and approved for my replacement of the phone. They couldn't justify anything for the cause. The phone also shown other issues like  1.  over heating while using camera applications.  2. over heating while more than 2-3 applications opened same time.  3.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I like everything about this phone, from camera features to the speed. But I am a traveller and here are the things that you just can't shake of.1. I believe this size of phone is too big for me. It feels whenever I am moving around, it's difficult to fit in my pocket. And it's difficult to hold this phone in one hand.2. The next big issue is headphone jack. I thought it's a good idea to buy a phone without headphone jack and work only with Bluetooth earphones. But it's just not the same. Whenever you are sitting medicating, those breaks in the sound from Bluetooth headphones are just irritating.I even bought OnePlus bullet headphones, they are really awesome. But Everytime to listen to music you need to charge two devices. What if you are traveling and you forgot to charge earphones?This phone just feels overwhelming at times.I wish OnePlus makes a simple phone with it's amazing camera and speed.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a performance phone. I've been using this set for nearly 2 weeks and I haven't faced any lags or heating issues even when I open multiple tabs or games simultaneously.I noticed a lot of op6t users are facing lags in in-display fingerprint scanner I think it should be said that it only works perfectly if you place your finger right on the spot where the greenish light shows up during unlocking and even if this doesn't help what you can do is add two or three finger imprints of the same finger.Its taking some time to unlock, maybe because it's one of the first generation phone that has in-display fingerprint sensor (after a considerable improvements over the other phones that has been previous released). If it makes you feel any better then the scanner actually becomes faster with its usage believe it or not it actually happened in my case .Coming to camera , OnePlus competes with every other flagship phones in almost all aspects but I believe certain camera improvements are yet to come.The nightscape mode actually surprised me when i tried to take a picture at about midnight but the picture becomes a bit blurry when one tries to zoom in and take a photo though this can be overcomed by using a telephoto lens but then our budget would be compromised.Another issue, new users might be facing is the flickering of videos when you're recording in slow motion under fluorescent lights, thats because if the frame rate exceeds 120 fps then it will capture frames faster than fluorescent lights so if you capture in artificial lights you will see flickering.The charging is explosively fast, it charges from 0 to 80% in about 30 to 35 minutes.the button vibrate mode and silent mode really comes in handy.Lastly considering the price range what I am getting is pretty great. There's a reason why OnePlus is overthrowing Apple sales in India.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Loving the new phone. Great product. Super smooth performance and fantastic battery life (ensures that type c port is mostly available for earphones. Im not missing 3.5mm jack).But would like to bring Oneplus's attention to the following concerns:1) Finger print sensor is great novelty tech but amature performance. Works well when it does but on most occasions, it is far from fluid. Quite inconsistent and erratic. Btw, using oneplus screen protector only. So no excuses (Rating 2/5)2) the camera quality could have certainly been better. One can manage great shots, but not regularly. Nightmode is definitely a gimmick. (3.25/5)3) wallpapers on lockscreen have a green tinge. Please fix it through a software update.4) screen is beautiful but auto brightness adjustment sucks. It can be very inaccurate and not smooth. Very annoying.5) No headphones are provided with the phone! Not cool.Despite the above, I am quite satisfied with this phone. Would recommend to anyone who does not have small hands to hold the big sized phone. Dont get me wrong, it looks and feels quite sleek.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've seen people cribbing about how 6T is not worth upgrading to. Well, What they don't say is, it's not worth upgrading if you own a Oneplus 6. Apart from 6, If you own any other smartphone, Its a bang for a buck and a truly amazing experience awaits if you switch. Well, I've upgraded from a 4-year-old Nexus 5 to 6t and boy am I impressed?Build & DesignI was amazed by the truly bezel-less design and an amazing 6.4-inch screen. Fantastic design and build quality. Youtube videos are stunning at HD and if you are a gamer, this is the screen is for you! The notch. It's the best the technology could get close to acheive a bezel-less display. Trust me, It adds to the design and it's not odd at all.SoftwareBetter than stock! Say's the one who's been using stock for 4 years in a Nexus 5. Oxygen just fly. The speed you need!In-display Fingerprint SensorIt's true that the sensor learns your pattern over time. It got super fast over a period of time. I've turned off face unlock. The fingerprint sensor is just way too convenient as it's right where your thumb already is while you operate your phone.CameraI've attached a few sample images. Those are untouched and raw images. The primary camera is probably the best in the market (excluding Pixel). The images are crystal clear. Well, balanced colors. Portraits are great. DSLR quality images right out of our pocket. But pretty disappointed with the nightscape feature. It doesn't do what it's supposed to do.  Other than that, The camera is simply awesome!BatteryI get 26 hours with an average day to day usage on weekdays. Since I use it a bit more heavily on weekends, I get about 22 - 24 hours with a continuous screen time of 6-7 hours. Over and above the dash charger does the rest of the magic. 10 - 100% in just 1 hour.SpeakersThe bottom firing speakers are great for indoor music. But Oneplus could have look at the stereo option for the 6T. A little disappointment there.Overall the 6T is worth every penny you spend. You are getting the best of everything at a reasonable price. The 6T will keep you on trend and updated at least for the next 2 years. Just go for it :)

I have played PUBG on this with extreme graphics settings. It runs smoothly.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros still outweigh the cons and minor inconveniences.Pros.1. Great display and best implementation of the notch. This is the only phone where notch can be hid in every single App I have used so far (LG G7 phones notch only hides the lock screen and system pages and not third party apps)2. Brilliant camera. The night mode shots are perfect and way superior than any camera. Even better than most DSLR. However recommended to use trypods to geteven better results.3. Software. Simply can say better than stock Android. Lot of shortcuts, guesturs and customizable options. Buttery smooth and lag free.4. Dash charging. Super fast and power bank has become redudant in my case.Cons.1. No head phones jack. (Why One plus?) I already lost the headphone dongle.2. In display finger print scanner is not that accurate in detection. 30% I find myself redoing it. At the same time it's slow.3. Feels bulky compared to one plus 3I used this phone for 3 weeks now and worked well with international roaming in China & UAE with no call drops and high speed data.Completely recomed this phone ..

4.0 out of 5 stars,"The OnePlus 6T is an excellent phone, with no lag and a very clear display.The only place where I see it lacking is that the speakers are positioned in such a way that the sound often gets muted when you hold the phone in landscape.The camera takes good pictures,but under low light conditions it isn't up to the mark.the photos are grainy and blur easily.Considering the price , this is quite unfortunate.Overall the phone is great,i found that there is an issue where the screen unlocks randomly or the display is being pressed without me doing so,other than that it's all good.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"See first time i am triggering review on Amazon so don't consider as biased.This phone will never let you feel less/low in any parameterBattery chargings super fast 63 percent in 30 minutes and lasts for a full day.Display quality is too good.Camera quality is all the way good moreover we can install google camera for astonishing pictures. Yes 6T supports google camera.Processor is not the point to discuss here as we all know this phone is very well known for speed itself.Hidden finger print sensor can make you feel slow but it depends upon the position of your finger or thump. Keep it on right place it's very fast moreover you have face unlock which will not give you time to put your finger on sensor. Face unlock is super fast.So at last don't think twice go for it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered OnePlus 6T on the day of launch. Amazon delivered in a day. Wonderful, as usual.The phone is blazing fast and it's positives are well documented across review websites and blogs. I am covering just my 1 day of initial experience with the phone.UNBOXING - The package has a phone, charger, a 3.5 mm jack to Type C converter, a silicon case. The phone has a screen protector already fixed hence doesn't need another.Type C converter is very useful for those using wired earphones. I use OneMore triple driver and this converter is handy.BUILT - I have upgraded from Oneplus 3. There was nothing wrong with my previous phone just that couldn't resist upgrading. My OP3 feels slightly sleeker than this one. I must say I like the metal back of OP3 as compared to this. The rest of it is pretty good.SCREEN - OP6T is clearly well ahead on this count. The resolution is better and so is the color quality. The difference can clearly be felt on pictures.DATA Transfer - there is an OP switch app on playstore. Use that and it works like a charm. 36GB moved in 37 minutes with zero loss. Contacts, SMS, logs, media, apps, accounts, etc. For other phones upgrades too there are apps available.NO 3.5 mm jack - I am a fan of my wired ear phones (I invested in OneMore triple driver which cost 9k) Convertor is a useful tool but the main issue is you can either charge the phone or use the earphones but not both at the same time.No NOTIFICATION LED - I miss the fact that I could just glance from far to my phone and know that it needs to be seen. Here I have to lift and open it.IN SCREEN FINGERPRINT - Saves some screen estate for sure and makes the screen feel larger. However it's not as fast and efficient as the hardware finger print. Also, hardware finger print works the moment u place the finger on it even when phone is asleep. Here u move the phone, it activates the screen and then u finger scan. Small advise - activate 'double tap to wake' and 'face unlock' and 'ok Google' so that u have multiple options to unlock the phone.All in all, I still find the phone well worth to posses specially for the camera. I am a happy user.

5.0 out of 5 stars," You've probably watched various reviews on YouTube so I'll cut to the chase.If you want a very fast and smooth OS experience, no lag, timely software updates along with the premium feel, just go for it.Fingerprint Scanner : Sometimes it's crazy fast, sometimes it takes time, you get used to it. After using indisplay fingerprint scanner, you'll forget about rear mounted ones.Notch : This looks extremely good compared to oneplus 6Camera : Both Cameras nowhere close to my S9+. But easily beats a number of other smartphones.Storage : you get around 115gb freeRam: 6gb is more than enough. 4000 inr for extra 2gb is not worth it.Face Unlock : Probably The Fastest Out There.Gaming : Games load faster than ever.A lot Faster Than S9+Display : Display is crisp and clear with FHD+ resolution. But since i have been using S9+ also so i can clearly see difference between QHD and FHD display. Brightness is less compared to S9+. HDR 4K videos are supported in 6TCharging : 1 hour 15 minutes for full charge ( Can Vary Depending On How and When You Plug In)OS :  Android 9 With November Security PatchSpeakers : Same As 5T,6. Nothing New HereAudio Jack : Gone. Using Dongle Is Not Everyone's Cup Of Tea. But Those Prebooked Will Get Type C Earphones. So no worries here.Heavier Than 5T,6 due to increased battery size.Hope you find this useful for your purchaseNote : Don't Compare This To Trash Phones Like Poco , Zenfone etc.

(I regret my choice) Camera:Both phones have a great Camera but vivo has that white'sh shade in photo that we usually see on oppo&vivo but I don't think that is a valid reason to say it's not as  1+.Build quality:1+ comes with glass back and looks much premium but Vivo's duel shade back is no looser tho.FaceUnlock Speed:I might sound wierd but I think Face unlock speed on vivo is twice as on 1+ and the phone never misses. Graphics:Both phone are euqal no one looses here. Battery: Without a single doubt in my mind I can say V11 is the winner here.(on a 100%charge on both phones we started playing PUBG on high graphics and full volume my 1+ was switched off after 6 round of games but V11 had 20% of juice left in it) and finally Price: I really really regret buying 6t instead of V11pro which has all the similar feature for almost half of the prize. I would recommend Vivo v11 pro any time to anyone.

Need to mention the Nightscape mode especially, it gives a great picture as if it's very clear even in the pitch dark!! Oh God! The battery! The battery life is the coolest thing in here! I only charge once in a day to 100% and that's all. With continuous use of the social apps like FB, WhatsApp and Instagram and gaming for 3-4 hours the battery isn't under 15% after 13-14 hours 😍😍 Even though I hated the large screen phones(one of the reasons I bought iPhone SE) this one looks different though!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just love this phone. This is a review after 1 months of use. This phone has amazing battery life, even though it's just 3700mah. That's largely because of the optimization of Oxygen OS done by OnePlus. It's like Android on Steroids. Blazzingly fast and smooth. The best of all, awesome battery life.I consider myself to be a very modest user of smartphone. I don't play any games and my only uses comes from taking calls, occasional social media and web browsing. My phone always has LTE on, and screen brightness set to 70%. And amazingly I have had battery lasting me for more than 2 days at times. Attached screenshot is just taken, and you can see for yourself. I have had last full charge 2 days ago, with 2hrs of total screen on-time till now. And it still shows my battery will last for another 1day 22hrs based on my current usage pattern, with 48% battery left. That too with Battery Saver mode not activated. I have set Battery Saver mode to activate when battery reaches 15%.And if you need to recharge, the Dash Charger can full charge 6T in just under an hour. That's just Awesome. I would recommend this phone to anyone who needs a phone that just lasts longer, much longer than Note 9 without a hefty price tag but with a battery that's just shy 300mah at 3700mah instead of 4000mah offered in Note 9.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone is a finger print magnet. Would not be surprised if the company does not make the entire phone a full fingerprint sensor later. A phone to suit a subdued user who likes reading a lot, music and taking the occasional picture.

Overall a very good experience with Android and the phone does deserve a good thump in the back. This phone is definetely stylish, gives a premium feel and will give a serious run for money to Samsung.Couoled with the battery and the wireless earbud from Oneplus themselves, this phone is keeper and a very good handyman.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased the device on 4th Nov 2018.I can say you can not find a better phone at this price tag.It surely justifies it's flagship specification.Even at some points it beats other flagship phones too.But as no phone is perfect, there are some thumbs down too.The best parts of the phone are1. Design2. Display3. oxygen OS4. Camera5. Battery life6. Also the quick updates you get from OnePlusSo big fat thumbs up for all these virtues.Now comes the loop holes-1. Headphone jack... Some may be ok with it but you need to always carry the dongle provided in box if you are an user of traditional earphones2. Night mode in camera is not up to the mark. I can say normal mode camera clicks better dim light snaps than night mode.3. Speaker is sufficiently loud but absence of dual speaker clearly makes the difference.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am NOT satisfied with this product at all due to battery and sound issues. Within one week I had to call and discuss long about the issues with Amazon support team and technician also send to my home to check within one week of this product purchase. Technician has come to my  home and watched a movie for 20 minutes on mobile data and wrote a report that no defective found with mobile (because, battery drained from 33% to 28%, it is just 5% reduction; is it the technical checking and report? Isn't it funny ? ). Today morning 6 am battery was at 95% and at 3 pm battery was 21%. I did not used much the phone during this period, only few short calls, only technician has watched movie for 20 minutes. On calls sound goes up anf drops suddenly. I am totally unsatisfied with this product quality spending 47 thounds rupees. I disppointed with Amazon support team for long calls and the way they advice customers on product quality and endorse the brand product. I can not recommend this product any other.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best phone purchased till date. I'm in love with the Samsung m30, especially because its a budget phone and provides so many great features. Talking about the battery life - It runs for almost 2 days with heavy usage especially when I play my favourite Pubg game. It doesn't even lag either which in return enhances my gaming experiance. I love streaming HD videos on Netflix and the clarity is phenominal. Talking about the camera, it captures beautiful images which can be easily compared to photos clicked on DSLR. The charcoal colour which I picked is the best and it has 64GB memory inbuild which helps me store all photos and videos. It's a great buy for everyone and I love it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"With this price, you get a smooth operating device and the notch display is class apart.Beautiful integration of features to say the least, the fingerprint sensor on the display makes it even more dynamic.Well I do miss the headphone jack but type C adapter makes up for it, also it is the way forward where i believe i would be using Bluetooth headsets in near future.Camera is the most stable camera i have seen till date, Nightscape mode indeed provides you with better options for low-light photography.Gaming mode is another X-factor about this phone, I mean WOW ! Oxygen OS allows the phone to just flow like a fluid. Couldn't have asked for anything better. It's worth an investment and at some point i also feel so many upgrades at this range is as good as a bargain.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have ordered OnePlus 6T on 1st Nov and received it on 2nd Nov, so it's a month now and I think I can give my review about this phone. I was previously using MiA1 from Xiaomi. I was ready to invest 42K for this phone as I was aware of what I am getting into, this phone is worth 42K.The processor, the RAM, storage, battery, display, camera, OxygenOS, dash charging, under display finger print scanner, oneplus support and service are all top notch.I have no complaints about a missing audio jack, trust me it is not a big deal and eventually every other phone maker is going to skip it. The absence of wireless charging is also not an issue for me personally.I have received 3 OxygenOS updates and after each update the speed of under display finger print unlock is enhancing and getting better.This is a great phone as every other OnePlus Device.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have always been drawn to Oneplus devices. I previously had Oneplus 3T. I had no issues with that device either.. Oxygen OS is buttery smooth. Great User experience. There's nothing worth complaining about 6T. The camera quality is great and 115 gigs of storage is enough. The under display finger print works great everytime. Face unlock has never been an issue. This device is snappy af. The SD845 delivers great power.. Well i need to buy an c type earphone eventually but that's just nit picking. Worth every money spent on this device. Moreover i just got it for 25750 with cashify giving me an amazing discount for my Asus Zenfone 5z. It's the sweetest deal i have got.

With a normal usage (4g, on wi-fi continuously, video watching, social media, normal gaming) battery lasts atleast 10-12hrs. Standby time i got was 2 days (i only used to make calls and some lite reading). worth every penny.Only downsize is no 3.5mm jack (but they have provided an adapter in the box). Bullets earphone is worthless. sound clarity is very poor. So if you are planning to buy bullets (coz of all the hype), please don't. It's not worth it. For 1500, you'll get better quality earphone and can use those with the adapter on this phone.

Apart from this, the phone is really good especially if you're upgrading from something like an OP3T and below. 10/10 would recommend, don't listen to the salty OnePlus haters just because it doesn't have a headphone jack. The UI is just too fluidic and snappy that you wouldn't feel like letting go of it even for a minute.PS: If it weren't for those dust particles I would've given this a 5 🌟

5.0 out of 5 stars,"At first I was reluctant while narrowing my choice because of some negative reviews on Oneplus 6. In the end I chose One Plus 6T based on the solid specifications the company provides against the price category. Logically Oneplus 6T stood out of the crowd out there. I made my choice and I never regretted. Good battery life. Even after six to seven hours of screen usage including WIFI, Mobile 4G, a bit of gaming, reading and social networking, the lowest percentage I get is 35%. On the average, I use a little more than 50% of the juice before recharging on the next morning. The phone is sufficient for any power user - it doesn't lack speed with multiple apps open. The screen wont compare with the Samsung's screen but not to a great amount to loose sleep over it. Overall, good value for money.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome product. We got it for 34K. My husband absolutely loves it and he uses it for personal use and for Work. He was really confused about buying 6T or Honor View 20. After his research he made the right choice. Because V20 is piece of garbage for this price. And I don't what people are complaing about.Phone looks great, excellent performance and up to 2 days battery on normal usage (Gaming Not included but game is really nice and smooth on this).

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best phone I've ever purchased. It's design and build is top class and so is the blazing performance. Battery life is super good. Camera is great and the screen is oled so colors are vibrant and beautiful specially those blacks. Fingerprint sensor isn't as fast a physical one but still is fast enough and a cool tech. The only little con is that there's no wireless charging and jack with the phone. It's software though is the best in my opinion as it only adds to the phone experience rather than detract from it. OS is slick, fast updates and it's very well optimised. Its a flagship phone for not a flagship price. OnePlus 6t is a plus plus for me in every way.

The device came next day morning and trust me.. This device will amaze you.The device is very fast and battery is long lasting. In most cases, apps loaded faster than the latest XR (my friend and I were testing) and the OnePlus Camera is better than iPhone XR.The fingerprint unlock works as it should. It takes a little time longer than the screen unlock.Overall, this is the perfect device if you don't want to spend a fortune on the latest iPhone and want to give this a try.

And luckily, I have chosen an awesome product! OnePlus 6T is soooo smooth to use! The specs are unbelievable. The battery is big and easily lasts more than a day. But for me the camera is the biggest surprise. It is so much better than my expectations, especially the night mode. Yes, the phone speaker could have been much better as compared to Nexus/Pixel phones. But the Bullets Earphones totally make up for it.

It also only takes about half an hour to an hour to charge fully. Screen is very responsive and the size is comfortable enough to use with one thumb while holding with the same hand. The plastic back case and pre-attached screen protector really mean it is ready to use straight out of the box. I genuinely love this phone. Only downside is the lack of headphone jack but you do get an adaptor in the box. In my opinion, you really need to try this phone. It has it all for a fraction of the price!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"One plus has continued to deliver flagship killer and that's true with this model. Among first in display fingersensor and drop notch, this phone delivers flagship performance in competitive price. Camera has improved over one plus 6, optic amoled is crisp, with good contrast and brightness. Sound quality stands out in similar price range. Battery is good enough to last for one and half day on normal usage. Watching high resolution videos, pics is a treat on this phone. Probably the next one will have tagline 'performance evolved'.

On screen fingerprint scanner is super awesome and works similar as physical one. Camera though it's similar to OP6 but the software changes has made this better and Nightscape is awesome. Have been using for a month with no issues at all. Battery life is also pretty good average use will give you 1.5 days and heavy usage will give you easily 1 day.

Let down for me was removing traditional 3.5 mm jack. Converter for headphone will be lost soon if I keep using it during travel. Waiting for free earphone from OnePlus since I pre-ordered.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"On an overall perspective the OnePlus 6T is the best Mid Range flagship. Everything about this phone is just great.The 6.41 inch display looks little big first hand. But after a months use you'll eventually get used to the size. The highest resolution you can watch on this is 1080 which is a bummer for the phone that hosts an Super AMOLED display.The phone hosts a stereo speaker which is loud enough for playing music while on the go.The battery life is amazing for a days use. For some one who uses the ohone in a very minimal way can use upto 2 days.

The night mode camera is not worth as it needs you to hold phone tight and it takes picture with higher time of exposure. The picture blurs.The phone hangs big time, it hung when watching Netflix, where the video was running, but all controls got stuck. The phone didn't switch off even when I tried to press the power button for long time. Had to wait till Netflix drained out the battery. A big disappointment.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall a good phone. Excellent battery life and performance. Good camera and speaker. Fingerprint scanner is not as fast or accurate as I expected but gets the job done. Small software bugs here and there, but nothing to worry about. Fast charging is also nice.The biggest drawback is the lack of headphone jack. It is incredibly annoying to use a dongle/adapter every time I have to use headphones. Also the adapter included in the box doesn't look durable.

Camera is good and specially the nightscape mode.Charging is very fast with the dash charger. Fingerprint and face unlock is swift. This is a kind of phone you can easily recommend to someone.But they could have easily added the headphone jack.Cheers to one plus. They should keep up the good work.

Thus it's obvious that this device sure to be a better than it's predecessor. The display is vibrant. The picture quality is great but not excellent. The battery lasts for a complete day with average usage. The sound quality is also great. Only revolutionary aspect is it's In-Display finger print sensor and works flawlessly fast.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this phone and within 1 month I have started facing problems. The lock/unlock is very slow, even slower is the fingerprint scanner. Whenever I take a picture in night mode, the phone hangs and I have to restart it every time. Overall also, the phone is a bit slow as compared to my previous phone (one plus 5). Performance wise also one plus 5 was way better than one plus 6T.On contacting the customer care, they will just give you some force restart and format steps which will not really help.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is undoubtedly one of the best smartphone with top notch performance at a rate as much as half the price of iPhone X. Camera mode comes with different variants which makes it look really cool. A Booster for gaming, which comes with different configurations to handle the notifications and calls. Its long lasting battery, fast charging, navigation bar customization, quick on-screen fingerprint scanner, and plenty of storage, makes it a sensational smartphone at a much lower price than iPhone X, mate 20 pro and pixel 3.

Smooth performance in opening any apps and given the way One Plus has optimised their oxygen OS, there is no lag at all. Go for the device if you have the budget.
